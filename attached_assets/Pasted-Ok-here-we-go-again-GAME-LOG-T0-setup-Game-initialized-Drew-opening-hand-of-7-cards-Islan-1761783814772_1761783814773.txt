Hand Evaluation
This hand meets the mulligan "must have" guidance: 2 lands and a cheap cantrip (Ponder) plus an interaction (Go for the Throat). That gives you a playable turn‑1 (Ponder) to sculpt the rest of the hand and a realistic chance to find black mana or ramp before you need it. Storm of Saruman and Witch‑king are high‑impact but expensive cards — not immediately castable here, but they are fine to dig for and set up later. Ringsight is a useful tutor effect if you can get a legendary creature or the proper colors online. The main risk is you currently have no black sources, so Go for the Throat, Ringsight (1UB), and Witch‑king (BB) are uncastable until you draw a black land or a ramp/fixing — however Ponder can help find that and two lands is within the preferred 1–2 range. Overall there is a clear, reasonable line of play (turn 1 Ponder to find a black source or ramp/further cantrips, keep interaction for when you have B, hold Storm until you can reasonably get 6 mana or copy density), so the hand is playable and worth keeping rather than mulliganing.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Underground River (index 7). We have 0 mana available and haven't used our land drop — playing a land is the highest-priority, free action this turn. Underground River is the most flexible play: it can produce U or B (or colorless) on future turns, which helps cast Ponder, Ringsight, and Go for the Throat sooner and supports the UB commander plan. The 1 damage from using its colored mode is negligible early in Commander and worth the color fixing. Playing a land advances our mana plan immediately; we cannot cast any spells now because available mana = 0.

ENGINE
AI Strategic Decision
Cast Ponder (index 1). With 2 available mana including one blue, Ponder is the highest-value, mana-efficient engine play this turn: it uses the available blue, gives immediate card selection/draw to find ramp, removal, or the commander, and advances the early-game plan of card advantage. There are no other legal spells (Go for the Throat needs black; other spells are too expensive), so spending the blue on a cantrip is optimal even though 1 colorless will remain unused.

No playable spells or activatable hand abilities given the current mana. You have 1 total mana available and you've already played a land this turn, but every spell in hand requires more mana or specific colors (Go for the Throat and Feed the Swarm need black; Ringsight, Storm of Saruman, and Witch-king are too expensive). There are no 0-cost or cycling-from-hand options available. Under the CRITICAL MANA RULES, when nothing castable remains, the correct play is to pass and preserve resources for the next turn.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play a land first per the priority rules. I haven't played a land this turn, and with only 2 total mana (U:1,C:1) I can't cast any of the nonland spells in hand (most are too expensive or require black mana). Dropping Island (hand index 0) increases future available mana and enables cast options on subsequent phases/turns. This follows the MANA-first sequencing guidance and avoids wasting the turn.

No legal casts are available with the current mana and board.

There are also no hand-activated abilities to use.

You have 3 total mana (U:2, C:1) but no black pip available and you've already played a land this turn.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Island (card index 3) as my land drop. I have not played a land this turn and increasing my available lands is the highest priority — it advances my MANA tier for upcoming turns and enables casting my primarily black spells (Lord of the Nazgûl, Witch‑king, One Ring, Feed the Swarm, Ringsight) on turn 4+. I currently have no legally castable spells that require only the blue/colourless mana available (most spells need black or much more mana), so playing a land is the most efficient use of this turn and follows the Turn 1–3 early-game guidance.

AI Strategic Decision
I cannot legally cast any spells this turn: every spell in hand requires black mana or more total mana than is available (Storm of Saruman needs 6 total, all others require at least one B). The correct and highest-value play is to take my land drop to improve future flexibility. Playing Underground River prioritizes color fixing (getting access to black) so I can cast Nazgûl or other black spells next turn and progress toward the deck's midgame engine (Lord of the Nazgûl + Wraith generation). This follows the MANA-first step in the sequencing plan and avoids wasting the turn.

Step 1 priority: play a land. I have a Swamp in hand and haven't played a land this turn.

With the current mana pool (U:3, C:1, B:0) I cannot legally cast any black spells in hand right now, so the correct play is to drop the land to advance mana base rather than passing.

AI Strategic Decision
Casting Lord of the Nazgûl is the highest-value midgame play: it establishes the primary engine so that subsequent cheap spells will produce Wraiths. You have exactly the mana and the color requirements to cast it now (5 total with U and B available), and passing or leaving mana unused would be suboptimal. Although ideally you'd follow up immediately with more spells to generate tokens, advancing the engine this turn is better than casting a lesser standalone spell. This play keeps future turns open to cast multiple instants/sorceries for immediate board development.

Cast Ringsight ({1}{U}{B}). It is a high-value engine play that (1) triggers Lord of the Nazgûl to create at least one Wraith token, (2) tutors a card that shares a color with a legendary creature you control (fetching a key piece like Witch-king, Nazgûl, or another black/blue legendary), and (3) uses mana efficiently while leaving room (2 mana) to follow up on the next decision. Prioritizing this sorcery follows the SYNERGY guidance (🌟) and the ENGINE tier — advances card advantage and leverages the Lord trigger better than simply playing a creature or artifact now.

Cast Go for the Throat (index 1). It costs {1}{B}, which is affordable with the current pool (5 total, including B:1). Casting this instant removes an opposing nonartifact creature while also triggering Lord of the Nazgûl to create an additional Wraith token — double value (removal + token). This advances the board (removes a blocker/threat) and builds the swarm needed to close the game. It's the highest-value, mana-efficient play that leverages the deck's synergies this turn.

Whispersilk Cloak (CMC 3, generic) is the only meaningful spell you can cast with the available mana and it uses your entire pool productively. Casting the Cloak advances the gameplan by giving you a protective/evasion piece for your commander (and later can be equipped to make it unblockable and untargetable), rather than passing with unused mana. Note: it won’t trigger Lord of the Nazgûl (only instants/sorceries do), but it’s the best use of the blue mana this turn.

AI Strategic Decision
You have 0 available mana and no lands in hand to play. None of the cards in hand are castable (all require black or other mana), and there are no battlefield activated abilities available to use. Because you cannot legally or productively cast anything this main phase, the optimal play is to pass and proceed to combat/prompt the next action.

main1
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have 0 available mana and no lands in hand, so you cannot cast any spells this main phase (all playable cards in hand require at least one black or more mana). There are no usable battlefield activated abilities available. Because no productive play is legal, the correct play is to pass and proceed to combat. In combat, attack with the single ready 3/3 menace creature to apply 3 damage and preserve the hand for next turn when you can generate black mana to cast high-value synergy spells (Shelob's Ambush or Feed the Swarm) that trigger Lord of the Nazgûl.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have 0 available mana and no lands in hand to play. Every meaningful spell in hand requires at least {B}, and there are no 0-cost or free battlefield/hand abilities available to use now. Therefore the only legal, non-detrimental action this step is to pass. Passing preserves game state until your next turn when mana will be available and you can then cast spells that utilize Lord of the Nazgûl's trigger and advance your board.

AI Strategic Decision
You have 0 available mana and no lands in hand, and there are no 0-cost or activatable abilities available. Every meaningful spell in hand requires at least {B}, so you cannot legally cast anything this step. Passing preserves game state and lets you use your mana on your next turn to play a land and/or cast high-synergy spells (Shelob's Ambush or Feed the Swarm) that will trigger Lord of the Nazgûl and advance the board.
