Hand Evaluation
This hand hits the deck's must-have boxes: it has 1+ land (Flooded Grove), an internal ramp/pivot (Incubation Druid) and multiple early counter synergies (Tromell, Shelinda, Together Forever, O'aka). That lets you seed +1/+1 counters early and accelerate into the midgame proliferate/anthem plan. Practical plan: turn 1 land, turn 2 play Incubation Druid or Shelinda (depending on available colors), use Together Forever/Tromell on turns 2‚Äì4 to put extra counters and set up later Inexorable Tide (a powerful midgame engine). Downsides: only one land and no zero-cost artifact ramp this hand makes early curve a bit tight and delays casting Inexorable Tide, so you'll need to sequence carefully and prioritize getting Incubation or Tromell down. Overall the hand is synergistic and playable ‚Äî it can productively execute the deck‚Äôs counter/proliferate gameplan.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Take the turn 1 land drop. Flooded Grove is the better play over Island because it gives flexible color options (G/U) for the deck's green/blue early curve (Incubation Druid, Tromell, Shelinda) and fixes future casts of the G/W/U commander. This advances the MANA goal on turn 1 and preserves the Island as a follow-up land for pure blue requirements.

Every spell in hand has a converted mana cost >1 (O'aka 1U, Incubation Druid 1G, Shelinda GW, Together Forever WW, Tromell 2G, Inexorable Tide 3UUU), so none are castable with the current mana. There are no battlefield activated abilities available to use and you cannot play another land.

Make the land drop (Island). Hitting my land drop is the highest priority ‚Äî it increases available colors next turn (allowing white/blue plays like Shelinda, Auron, or O'aka) and follows the Decision Priority (play land first).

AI Strategic Decision
Cast Incubation Druid ({1}{G}) as the highest-value play this turn. It advances our MANA priority by adding a future mana engine (can later tap for any colour based on lands and potentially three mana if it gets a +1/+1 counter). It uses 2 of the available 4 mana efficiently, fits the early-game ramp plan, and keeps options open (after this resolves we'll be called again and can spend remaining mana). Other spells either require white/extra blue (Together Forever, Shelinda, Auron, Inexorable Tide) or are more of a midgame play (Tromell costs 3 and would leave 1 mana awkwardly unused now).

AI Strategic Decision
Tromell, Seymour's Butler ({2}{G}) is the best use of the available mana this turn. It costs 3 and uses our green pip, fitting the Decision Priority (MANA ‚Üí ENGINE ‚Üí THREAT). Tromell is an engine piece (proliferate) that advances the deck‚Äôs counter-based plan: it increases the value of future creature drops (they enter with additional +1/+1 counters) and gives an activated proliferate outlet later. Casting it now uses all available mana efficiently, accelerates midgame plans (enabling Incubation Druid to become a stronger mana source once counters are on it), and is higher impact than the cheaper O'aka. Mana/color requirements are satisfied (we have the green needed and 3 total mana).

Play a land first per the decision priority.

Cast O'aka, Traveling Merchant (1U). It's the only card in hand you can legally cast with the current pool (you have 1 blue and enough total mana). This develops the board (another creature), gives a repeatable card-draw sink once it's on the battlefield, and advances the deck's early-engine plan. It's a low-cost, high-utility play that uses mana efficiently and sets up future interactions with counters/engine cards. Other cards require white or an extra blue, so they are currently uncastable.

Activating Tromell (pay 1 + tap) is the highest-value play available now. It uses mana productively to advance the deck's +1/+1 counter engine, likely placing counters or otherwise enabling future Incubation Druid growth.

O'aka's 0-mana tap draw is the highest-value play available: it advances the engine by drawing a card without spending any of the 2 available mana, keeps mana open for casting something after the draw (or next turn), and follows the early-game goal of developing resources. No spells in hand are currently castable with the color/manapool restrictions, and playing the ability avoids passing with unused actions.

You currently have 0 white mana, so you cannot cast any of the white cards in hand.

This follows the MANA priority (advance mana/fixing first) and preserves your current mana for follow-up plays after this ability resolves. Fetching a Plains lets you cast Shelinda or Together Forever on a subsequent opportunity and generally advances the deck toward its midgame counter engines.

Cast Fathom Mage (cost {2}{G}{U}). This is the highest-value ENGINE play available: it advances our card-draw/counter plan (Evolve + card advantage when it gains counters), uses both colors we have (G and U) and makes good use of mana on curve. Inexorable Tide and Together Forever are unavailable due to color shortfalls (not enough blue or white), and while Shelinda is a solid lower-cost threat, Fathom Mage is the better midgame engine to enable future proliferate/evolve synergies and to convert upcoming creature drops into card advantage. We have 6 total mana and can pay Fathom Mage's cost (leaving 2 unused this action), and casting it now helps enable Incubation Druid and future counters interactions.
