Hand Evaluation
This hand is playable and fits the lenient mulligan guidance. You have 4 lands including multiple U/B sources (Sunken Hollow, Sunken Ruins, and two Swamps) so color and early mana are reliable. You also have a ramp-ish piece (Commander's Sphere) and two spells (Ringsight and Scroll of Isildur) that are meaningful game actions and count as instants/sorceries/enchantments for Lord of the Nazgûl triggers once your commander is out. It lacks a cheap cantrip or early counter/removal right now, and the Sphere is a bit slow compared to Sol Ring/Signet, but the hand has a clear path: play lands to hit turn 3–4 commander, use the Sphere/Sunken Ruins to accelerate, and start casting spells to generate Wraiths and pressure the table. Given the mulligan criteria (only mulligan truly unplayable hands), this is good enough to execute the deck’s gameplan.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play the Swamp (hand index 2). A basic Swamp is the cleanest turn‑1 play: it enters untapped, immediately fixes black for our early plays, and sets up future casts of our commander and removal. It avoids the downside of Sunken Hollow entering tapped and is simpler than Sunken Ruins' conditional abilities. Playing a land advances mana development (MANA) with no mana cost, which is the highest priority this turn.

Available mana is 1 total (B:1). I have already played my land this turn so I cannot play another. No card in hand has a casting cost of 1 or less or matches the lone black pip, and there are no hand-activated abilities (cycling, etc.) usable for 1 mana. Commander and all other spells are unaffordable. Per the priority rules, when nothing productive can be cast or activated this step, the correct play is to pass and retain resources for the next turn.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play the Swamp from hand. Land drop is priority #1 — it increases future available mana and progresses the mana plan for turns 3–4. Playing a basic now is better than playing Sunken Hollow or Sunken Ruins (which would enter tapped as your second land) and there are no castable spells for your single {B} this turn anyway.

You have 2 black mana in the pool and have already played your land this turn. There are no spells in hand that cost 2 or less or that can be paid with only black (all castable cards require blue or more mana or higher CMC), and there are no battlefield activated abilities available. Per the critical mana rules, you cannot "tap" lands or activate mana abilities manually. With no legal, productive play available, passing is optimal to preserve game state for next turn.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
No legal productive play is available. You have already taken your land drop this turn, there are no battlefield activated abilities you can use, and your available mana is 2 black (B:2) which cannot pay for any card in hand (all spells require blue and/or higher total mana). Casting the commander or any spell is impossible given the color and cost constraints, so the optimal play is to pass and preserve game state for next turn.

You have 2 black mana in the pool and have already taken your land drop this turn. None of the cards in hand can be cast for {B}{B} (they require blue or more total mana, e.g., Lord of the Nazgûl is 5 with U/B in cost, Scroll of Isildur is 2U). There are no battlefield activated abilities available and no hand abilities (cycling, etc.) that can be paid for with the available mana. Because playing a land is illegal (land drop already used) and no spells or abilities are castable/useful with the current pool, the only correct play is to pass and retain game state for next turn.
T2

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have 2 black mana in the pool (B:2) but no card in hand can be cast for {B}{B} or less: all non-land spells require blue or more total mana (Ringsight 1UB, Scroll of Isildur 2U, Commander's Sphere 3, Nazgûl Battle‑Mace 5). You have already taken your land drop and there are no hand-activated abilities or 0‑cost plays available. Under the critical mana rules, you cannot "tap" lands or activate battlefield mana from hand and floating unused mana would be wasted. Therefore the only correct play this step is to pass and retain the mana for the next turn.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play a land first per priority. Drowned Catacomb (index 7) will enter untapped because I already control a Swamp, and it provides flexible U/B mana which furthers the deck's early-game plan (enable future spells/commander). This uses the mandatory land drop without spending the available mana and improves mana base for upcoming turns.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Priority = MANA. Casting Commander's Sphere (CMC 3) uses the full 3 available mana to advance the deck's early-game plan by adding a permanent ramp/fixer that produces any color in the commander's identity on future turns and can be sacrificed for card draw later. It is the most mana-efficient play this turn and improves future turns (helps cast the commander or other colored spells). Ringsight is suboptimal because its search depends on a legendary creature you control (you currently control none). Scroll of Isildur is an engine but is less immediately impactful than getting a mana rock on board now. Therefore Sphere best advances the MANA → ENGINE → THREAT framework for turn 3.

AI Strategic Decision
Play a land first per sequencing priority. Sunken Hollow will enter untapped because I already control two or more basic lands (two Swamps), giving an untapped U/B source for future plays and improving color-fixing for casting Lord of the Nazgûl next turn. This advances the MANA plan without wasting the land drop and keeps options open for casting engine spells (like Scroll of Isildur) on the same turn after the land is played.

ENGINE
AI Strategic Decision
Spend mana efficiently this turn by casting Scroll of Isildur (cost {2}{U}). It advances an engine (a Saga) that can gain control of an opponent's artifact on chapter I and then provide further value on later chapters. It uses 3 of the available 4 mana, progressing the mid-game plan instead of passing with unused mana. Ringsight currently has limited value (it searches for a card that shares a color with a legendary creature you control, and you control no legendary creatures), and the Battle-Mace is unaffordable. Casting the Saga is the best productive play.

AI Strategic Decision
I haven't played a land this turn — play a land first. Sunken Ruins (hand index 1) is the best pick: it gives the most color flexibility (U/B options) for this UB commander deck and improves future mana fixing. Playing it now preserves the option to cast Lord of the Nazgûl (or other UB spells) with the available 5 mana on the next decision. Following the decision framework, Land drop (MANA) comes before casting spells.

THREAT
AI Strategic Decision
Cast Lord of the Nazgûl for {3}{U}{B} (5) now. This turn is the right time to get the commander on board: it immediately enables the deck's core engine (it will start creating Wraiths when you cast instants/sorceries on subsequent turns) and it makes Ringsight (in hand) functional next — Ringsight searches for a card that shares a color with a legendary creature you control, which requires the commander be on the battlefield. While Palantír is a solid engine, the commander is higher value here because it converts future spells into board presence and accelerates the mid-game plan. The color and total-mana requirements are satisfied by the current pool.

Prioritize ramp (MANA) on turn 6 — Sol Ring is the most impactful, mana-efficient play available. Casting Sol Ring now increases future mana available to accelerate engine/threat deployment (enables casting Nazgûl Battle‑Mace or additional engines in following turns) and follows the deck's early/mid-game guidance to play fast mana first. It costs only {1}, which is affordable from the current pool of 4 and preserves flexibility on subsequent decisions. This is better than spending 3 on Palantír this turn because ramp compounds value and fits the MANA>ENGINE>THREAT ordering.

THREAT
AI Strategic Decision
Casting Nazgûl Battle-Mace is the best use of available mana this main phase. It's a 5-cost artifact (colorless), so it's castable with the current 11 mana. The equipment advances the late-game plan by enabling a big threat/equipment combo with our commander (menace/deathtouch/annihilator provide immediate upside once equipped) and creates a clear follow-up line for this turn. Casting it now uses mana efficiently instead of passing, and after it resolves we'll be able to equip in the next prompt (we still have plenty of mana remaining to pay an equip cost then).

AI Strategic Decision
You have already played your land this turn and the only card in hand is a land (Island), so you cannot play it. There are no castable spells in hand and no battlefield activated abilities available to use. With 6 floating mana but no legal actions, passing is the correct play.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
No legal productive plays are available. I have already played my land this turn, the only card in hand is a land (Island) which cannot be played, and there are no castable spells or available battlefield activated abilities to pay for with the 6 mana in my pool. Mana abilities (tapping lands/rocks) cannot be manually activated and the pool cannot be spent on anything meaningful now. Under the decision framework, passing is the correct play.

AI Strategic Decision
You have already played a land this turn, so the Island in hand cannot be played. There are no castable spells in hand and no available battlefield activated abilities to use right now. Your commander is already on the battlefield, so castCommander is not an option. With no legal productive play this step, passing is correct per the rules (don’t activate mana abilities manually and don’t waste actions).

AI Strategic Decision
No legal productive play is available this step. I have already played a land this turn so the Island in hand cannot be played. There are no castable spells in hand and no battlefield activated abilities I can pay for. Mana abilities are automatic and cannot be manually activated. Given the CRITICAL rules and the decision priority, passing is correct to avoid illegal/inefficient actions.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play a land first per priority rules. Underground River (hand index 1) is the superior drop because it gives flexible U/B or colorless fixing for future turns (at the minor cost of 1 damage when tapped for U/B), which is more valuable for enabling future spells and maintaining tempo. We have not played a land yet this turn and must do so before other plays; this advances the MANA plan without wasting current available mana.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Bojuka Bog (hand index 1). Land drop is highest priority and Bojuka Bog's ETB exile is meaningful late-game disruption (removes opponents' recursion/yard resources). It also advances board state without spending mana and fits the deck's plan of denying opponents answers. We have ample mana already, so the tapped ETB downside is irrelevant this turn.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Take my land drop: play Barad-dûr from hand. With my commander already on the battlefield, Barad-dûr will enter untapped and immediately increase my available on-board mana sources and future flexibility (and provides the Amass activation later if a creature dies). I must use a land drop each turn when available; this advances the MANA plan and preserves my current 14-mana pool usage pattern for future turns. Playing Barad-dûr is strictly better than holding the Island because it gives a recurring black source and a useful late-game activated ability.
