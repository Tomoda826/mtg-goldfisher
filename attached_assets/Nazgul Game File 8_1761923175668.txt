Hand Evaluation
Hand has 4 lands (meets the 2-land requirement) and two cheap interaction/dig spells (Borne Upon a Wind — draws a card and enables flash-casting, and Sauron's Ransom — top-deck manipulation). It lacks an early mana artifact ramp piece, but the 4 lands give a reliable mana base to hit turns 2–4 plays (including casting The One Ring on curve around turn 4). Borne Upon can dig for ramp/commander/protection and Sauron's Ransom helps sculpt draws, so you have reasonable ways to find the commander, protection, or key engines. This hand can develop into the deck’s gameplan (get Lord online, start generating value with cantrips/dig, find protection/equipment) and is playable in the first 3–4 turns.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Sunken Ruins as the turn 1 land drop. It gives the best early color fixing for a Dimir deck (access to U and B) and can later generate double-colored mana options, helping cast the commander or early spells. It's preferable to Minas Morgul (enters tapped) and better color-flexibility than a basic Island on turn 1.

AI Strategic Decision
No legal productive plays available. I've already taken my land drop this turn (Sunken Ruins), so I cannot play another land. Available mana is 1 total; none of the spells in hand have a converted cost of 1 or less (The One Ring is 4, Sauron's Ransom 3, Borne Upon a Wind 2, Countersquall 2). There are no 0-cost activated abilities in hand or on the battlefield to use. Following the play-every-turn and mana-efficiency rules, passing is correct because there is literally nothing castable or activatable this main phase with the current resources.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Priority one is the land drop. I currently have 1 colorless mana and no colored mana, so I cannot legally cast any spells in hand (all spells require colored mana). Playing Island is optimal because it enters untapped and gives a blue source for Brainstorm / counters next turn, advancing our early-game goal of card selection and enabling cheap interaction. I avoid Minas Morgul (enters tapped) and prefer Island over Underground River because Island has no damage drawback and reliably provides U immediately.

Cast Brainstorm (index 6). Early game priority is card selection/engine — Brainstorm is the most efficient draw/filter available, helping find ramp, protection, or the commander. It only costs {U}, which matches the available blue mana, and preserves Borne Upon a Wind for a later turn when its flash effect will be more impactful. Although this leaves 1 generic mana unused this turn, the card selection value outweighs spending both mana on a lesser draw, and keeping flexible answers for future turns aligns with the deck plan.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Underground River (hand index 2). I haven't played a land this turn, and taking the land drop is the highest priority — it advances my mana base for future turns and enables casting B- or U-requiring spells next turn (e.g., Countersquall, Night's Whisper, Nazgûl). Underground River is preferable to Minas Morgul this turn because it doesn't enter tapped and gives flexible colors (U/B/C) later, improving my ability to use the 1U in my pool next turn. Playing a land now follows the MANA-first sequencing and avoids passing with an available land drop.

THREAT
AI Strategic Decision
Cast Nazgûl (index 6). It uses 3 of our 4 available mana to put a deathtouch creature on board, advancing our board presence and creating a legitimate threat/defender on turn 3. Nazgûl also sets up future synergies with The One Ring / Lord of the Nazgûl (its ETB 'the Ring tempts you' matters once we have the Ring), and gives us a permanent to attach protection/equipment to later (Mithril Coat or other protections). This follows the Decision Priority (advance board state / THREAT) and uses mana efficiently rather than holding unused mana. We keep 1 mana floating (unusable for meaningful plays this step) and can act again after this spell resolves.

Play Path of Ancestry as the land drop. Both lands in hand enter tapped, but Path gives future color-fixing for the commander and a scry trigger when its mana is used to cast a creature that matches the commander — excellent early-game card selection and synergy with the plan to find/protect Lord of the Nazgûl. This follows the play-priority (land first → MANA) and preserves mana for next turn while improving future draws.

AI Strategic Decision
Borne Upon a Wind (1U) is the best engine play this turn: it draws a card (card advantage) and lets you cast spells this turn as though they had flash, keeping future sequencing options open. It's an instant, so it advances the deck's synergies (casting instants/sorceries to trigger Lord of the Nazgûl-related plan) and only costs 2 mana, leaving 2 mana available to make another productive play after this resolves. Countersquall is NOT a good proactive play now because it requires a target on the stack; The One Ring would use all mana and prevent additional plays this turn. Therefore cast Borne Upon to maximize card selection and preserve flexibility.

This follows the deck plan to ramp into deploying the commander while preserving options to cast protection (Mithril Coat/The One Ring) or counters afterward. Note: Sol Ring's mana ability cannot be used until it is on the battlefield, and I am not manually activating any mana abilities now.

Casting it uses all available mana efficiently, advances the engine plan for turns 4–6 by refilling resources, and triggers any ‘cast an instant’ synergies in the deck.

This uses all available mana this main phase (avoids wasting mana), advances the board by putting a resilient, high-impact artifact into play, and its ETB protection (you gain protection from everything until your next turn) gives strong short-term insurance against removal. That lines up with the mid-game goal of deploying durable threats and protecting my future plays (including setting up to safely cast or attach things to my commander later). While Mithril Coat would protect a legendary creature, it costs {3} and would leave 1 mana unused; The One Ring is the more mana-efficient, higher-impact play this turn.

Primary rule: take the land drop first. Between the two lands in hand, Swamp (index 5) is the optimal play — it enters untapped and gives a clean black source for future plays without the drawback of Minas Morgul entering tapped. Although the mana pool is already full this turn, playing an untapped basic improves tempo and keeps Minas Morgul available to play later when its activated ability or battlefield presence would matter. Playing the Swamp advances the MANA priority and preserves flexibility for casting the commander or spells on subsequent steps.

Mid-game priority: deploy the commander now to begin enabling the deck's core engine. I have the required colors (U and B) and 11 available mana, so casting Lord of the Nazgûl for its current cost (5) is affordable and advances the gameplan (THREAT). After this resolves I will have 6 mana left and can immediately follow up by flashing in Mithril Coat (a separate action) to grant indestructible/protection to the commander if needed. Casting the commander now maximizes tempo and opens up the plan of casting cheap instants/sorceries each turn to build Wraiths and leverage Lord's abilities.

Cast Opt (cost {U}) to trigger Lord of the Nazgûl's token-creating ability while getting immediate card selection and draw. Opt is the most mana-efficient engine play (scry 1 + draw) that leverages the Lord synergy this turn, preserves most of the remaining mana for follow-up plays on the next step, and improves future turns by filtering into answers or ramp. Summoning sickness on Lord does not stop its triggered ability when you cast instants.

Cast Reanimate ({B}). It's the cheapest instant/sorcery that (1) uses your available black mana, (2) immediately triggers Lord of the Nazgûl to make another 3/3 Black Wraith token, and (3) puts a creature onto the battlefield to advance your board and pressure opponents. This follows the deck's mid‑game plan to cast cheap instants/sorceries to generate value from Lord. Reanimate costs only your single black pip, leaving 4 colorless for follow-up plays on resolution. Reanimate's life cost is acceptable at this stage.

THREAT
AI Strategic Decision
With only 4 colorless mana (no colored mana), the only playable spells are The One Ring (index 1) and Mithril Coat (index 4). Protecting my commander (Lord of the Nazgûl) is a high priority this midgame to enable further token generation and board development. Mithril Coat (3) enters and immediately attaches to a legendary creature I control, granting indestructible — giving immediate, targeted protection to Lord. It uses mana efficiently (3 of 4) and secures my engine. I cannot cast the instants in hand (they require U/B/B) so the synergy plays are unavailable this turn. If Mithril Coat were unavailable, I would cast The One Ring (index 1) to use the full 4 mana and gain broad protection for myself until my next turn.

Cast Mithril Coat (index 4). Protecting Lord of the Nazgûl this turn is the highest-priority engine play: the Coat enters and immediately attaches to a legendary creature you control, granting indestructible and securing your token engine against removal. It costs 3 and is castable with your 4/colorless mana, uses mana efficiently, and enables future turns where you can safely cast instants to trigger additional Wraith tokens. You cannot cast the U/B instants in hand because you have no colored mana, so Mithril Coat is the best playable option this step. (It leaves 1 unused mana, but no other productive play is available for that mana.)

You have 4 colorless mana and cannot cast your U/B instants (lack colored mana). Mithril Coat (index 4) costs {3} and has an enters-the-battlefield trigger that immediately attaches to a legendary creature you control, giving indestructible to that creature. Attaching it to Lord of the Nazgûl secures your engine so you can safely start casting instants on subsequent turns to generate Wraith tokens. This is the highest-value, mana-efficient play available this step and advances the deck's mid-game plan of protecting the Nazgûl engine. It uses most of the available mana and avoids passing with a usable play.

Mithril Coat (card index 4) costs {3} colorless and is castable with the 4 colorless available. Its ETB will attach to a legendary creature you control (attach it to Lord of the Nazgûl) and grant indestructible to him, securing your engine so you can safely start casting instants on subsequent turns to generate Wraith tokens. This uses mana efficiently, advances the mid‑game plan (protect the Nazgûl engine), and is preferable to casting The One Ring because it directly protects the commander and is cheaper, leaving no meaningful play for the remaining 1 mana this turn. You cannot cast the U/B spells in hand due to lacking colored mana, so this is the highest-value, playable option now.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Decision priority requires taking my land drop first. Playing Minas Morgul (index 0) uses the mandatory land drop, gives an additional black source for future plays, and enables its battlefield activated ability later (shadow counters) after it's on the battlefield. This preserves the current mana pool (I still have 11 available to spend after the land play) and keeps options open to cast high-value synergy instants (Sauron's Ransom / Saruman's Trickery / Countersquall / Orcish Medicine) on the same turn. Playing the land advances the MANA tier of the plan and avoids passing when a land is available.

Cast Orcish Medicine ({1}{B}) because it is a synergy instant (triggers Lord of the Nazgûl to create at least one Wraith) while also granting a valuable combat/protection effect and amassing Orcs 1. With 11 mana available, the 2-mana cost is efficient and leaves plenty of mana for follow-up plays after this resolves. I will target Lord of the Nazgûl with the spell and give it indestructible (or lifelink if situation shifts), protecting the key engine and improving our threat clock. This advances the late-game plan by building tokens and protecting our commander.

Cast Sauron's Ransom (instant, index 1). It's an instant that will trigger Lord of the Nazgûl and create another Wraith token while also providing its own disruptive/card-advantage effect. This play follows the synergy guidance (prefer 🌟 spells) and advances the engine without needing a spell on the stack to target (unlike the counterspells). It uses a portion of the available mana efficiently (3 mana), preserves flexibility with remaining mana to follow up after the spell resolves, and improves board presence immediately.

Mithril Coat (cost 3) is the best use of available mana and advances the deck's engine: its enter-the-battlefield trigger will attach to Lord of the Nazgûl, granting indestructible and ensuring our key token generator survives board wipes/targeted removal. Countersquall and Saruman's Trickery would be higher-value due to Lord triggers, but they are uncastable this turn (lack blue mana). The One Ring is castable but is less efficient for protecting the commander directly; Mithril Coat is a cheaper, more reliable protection play that preserves our ability to keep generating Wraiths on subsequent turns.

Cast Saruman's Trickery (1UU). It's a high-value, synergy play: casting an instant triggers Lord of the Nazgûl to create a Black Wraith token and Saruman's Amass 1 additionally gives a board creature (a 1/1 Orc Army if none exists). It also functions as a counterspell to stop a key opponent play. The play is mana-efficient (3 mana) and advances the engine (more tokens and board presence) while leaving ample mana to follow up later this turn.

Cast Countersquall ({U}{B}). It is the highest-value play this step because: (1) it is a 🌟 synergy card that will trigger Lord of the Nazgûl to create an additional 3/3 Black Wraith token, converting a single 2‑mana cast into board growth; (2) it provides immediate interaction (counters a noncreature spell and makes that opponent lose 2 life), which is relevant late-game; (3) it costs only 2 mana so it’s mana-efficient and preserves flexibility for responses or additional plays on subsequent steps/turns. I have the required colors and sufficient mana to cast it. This advances the engine plan (more tokens/Wraiths that scale with Lord) while keeping options open for the rest of the turn.

AI Strategic Decision
Cast The One Ring (card 0). It uses mana efficiently (4 of the 6 available), gives a high-impact protection/indestructible effect for the immediate turns and is a durable threat/voltron piece that advances the late-game kill plan. Protecting myself makes committing the Lord of the Nazgûl and my tokens to attack much safer and preserves board advantage. This is preferable to the smaller-board play (Orcish Bowmasters) because it uses more of the available mana now and creates a resilient game-winning axis going forward. After this resolves, I can reevaluate and likely cast Orcish Bowmasters with remaining mana on the next prompt.

Cast Go for the Throat (index 2). There is no land in hand to play, so the priority is to use available mana on a high-value, low-cost play. Go for the Throat is a 🌟 synergy card — it destroys an opponent's nonartifact creature and triggers Lord of the Nazgûl to create another 3/3 Wraith, advancing our engine and board presence for minimal mana. It's mana-efficient (1B), preserves most of the pool for a follow-up, and leverages the deck's late-game plan of building an overwhelming creature army. Casting removal now both clears blockers/threats and adds another attacker for upcoming combat.
