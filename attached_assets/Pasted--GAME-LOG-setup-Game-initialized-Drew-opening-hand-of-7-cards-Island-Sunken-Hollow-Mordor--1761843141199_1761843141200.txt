Hand Evaluation
This hand meets the lenient mulligan criteria from the playbook. You have 2–3+ early mana sources (actually 4 lands) and a cantrip (Opt), which are the core must-haves. While you don’t have a Sol Ring/Signet or immediate commander protection/removal in hand, the Opt + Mordor Muster give card selection and a small draw engine to find accelerants or protection in the next few turns. Mordor Muster also produces a creature and a card, so it’s at least a productive early play if you need board presence. Sunken Hollow may enter tapped unless you have two basics, but you still have multiple usable lands to hit your first few turns and get the commander out in a few turns to start the Wraith engine. Given the deck’s tolerance for slower starts as long as you have cantrips and land, this hand is “good enough” to execute the gameplan.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play The Grey Havens (index 6). It enters untapped and gives an immediate scry 1 on ETB, which is superior to a basic Island this turn because it provides card filtering plus a usable land for future turns. This advances the early-game plan (establishing reliable mana while improving card quality) without risking a tapped dual (Sunken Hollow) or waiting to activate land abilities later.

AI Strategic Decision
Available mana is 1 colorless only. I've already played my land for the turn, and there are no spells in hand that cost 1 colorless (Opt and the others require colored mana or more total mana). No battlefield activated abilities are available to use. Therefore I cannot legally or productively cast anything this main phase, so the optimal play is to pass.
T1
main1
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have 1 total mana (colorless) in the pool and you've already made your land drop this turn. Every spell in hand requires colored or additional mana (Opt needs {U}; Mordor Muster and Go for the Throat need {B} plus more; Ringwraiths is far too expensive). There are no 0-cost/battlefield activated abilities to use. Playing another land is illegal (land already played). Given the CRITICAL MANA RULES, no productive cast or activation is possible, so passing is the correct play to preserve tempo for next turn.

No legal casts or activations are available with the current mana and board state. I have already played my land for the turn, and the pool shows 1 colorless (no colored mana).

Per the critical rules I cannot (and must not) manually activate land mana abilities to try to pay costs. Therefore the only correct action is to pass and preserve resources for turn 2.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Primary priority is to make my land drop. Playing the Island is the safest, immediate play: it's a basic that won't enter tapped and preserves future options (it will help Sunken Hollow enter untapped later if I play it). This advances my mana base for upcoming turns and leaves my 1 mana pool untouched for instant-speed responses if needed.

AI Strategic Decision
Cast Opt (U). With 2 blue available, the best use is a cheap cantrip: it advances the early-game plan (card selection/draw toward Lord of the Nazgûl and other pieces) and is mana-efficient. It's instant-speed, so resolving it now lets me dig for answers/threats while still leaving 1 blue open for responses on opponents' turn. No other playable spells or useful activated abilities are available that improve the board more this turn.

AI Strategic Decision
I have 1 blue mana available but no playable spells that require only U. All castable spells in hand require black or more total mana (Mordor Muster, Go for the Throat, Shelob's Ambush, Not Dead After All, Ringwraiths) or are lands (can't play a land this turn — land drop already used). Commander costs also unaffordable. Because nothing legal can be cast right now, the correct play is to pass and preserve the game state for my next turn.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
I have only 1 blue mana available and no legal spells or activatable hand abilities I can pay for: all non-land cards in hand require black or more total mana, and some require creature targets (which I don't have). I have already used my land drop this turn, so I cannot play a land to fix colors. Casting nothing is forced — passing preserves game state so I can play a land and/or cast ramp or Lord of the Nazgûl next turn and follows the early-game plan.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
First priority is a land drop. Play Sunken Ruins (hand index 3) to increase future mana options without the enter-tapped drawback Sunken Hollow would have and without the conditional restriction Tainted Isle has (needs a Swamp). Sunken Ruins gives a reliable {C} now and later can produce U/U, U/B, or B/B with its activated ability, helping enable casting Lord of the Nazgûl on the next turn and improving color flexibility for removal or commander play. No castable spells this turn (all spells in hand require black), so a land drop is the highest-impact, mana-building play.

No playable spells or abilities are available given the current mana/colors and that a land has already been played this turn.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Sunken Hollow (hand index 0). Priority #1 is a land drop to advance the mana base toward casting black spells (Nazgûl, removal, etc.) next turn. Sunken Hollow will give reliable U/B production going forward (even though it will enter tapped this turn because I only control one basic), which is more useful for our gameplan than Tainted Isle (which only produces U/B if we control a Swamp). We currently have no black in our available mana pool, so playing a dual that grants black next turn is the best use of this action.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play the Swamp from hand. You must take your land drop (Step 1) and adding a Swamp is the highest-value play: it enables black casting next turn (including Nazgûl/Lord and your black removal), and it enables Tainted Isle's {U/B} option later. You currently have no black in your pool, so playing the Swamp won't let you cast black spells this turn, but not playing a land would be a wasted opportunity. This advances the MANA plan and preserves your current mana for potential responses.

AI Strategic Decision
Casting Lord of the Nazgûl for {3}{U}{B} (5) uses all available mana (U:3 B:1 C:1) and exactly meets the color requirements. This is the highest-value play this turn: it advances the deck's mid-game engine (the Lord creates Wraiths when you cast instants/sorceries), fits the stated gameplan to get the commander down as soon as practical, and enables double-value plays on later turns (spamming the instants in hand to generate tokens). Casting the commander now is more impactful than any single-card play from hand (the cheaper Nazgûl creature would consume your lone black and leave little follow-up, and the other spells either need black or target creatures you don't have).

Cast Frantic Search ({2}{U}). It is a high-value synergy spell (triggers Lord of the Nazgûl) that draws two cards and untaps up to three lands, enabling further spells this turn. That both creates a Wraith token now and refuels mana/card advantage so we can continue the mid-game plan (spam instants/sorceries to generate more tokens or answers). It's the most engine-efficient play with the current pool (U:1 B:3 C:2) and maximizes tempo for subsequent casts.

Mordor Muster ({1}{B}) is the best play this main phase: it's an ENGINE play (card draw + amass), is marked 🌟 so it triggers Lord of the Nazgûl to create additional Wraith(s), and it uses mana efficiently (2 of your 3 available). It advances the board by creating/amassing an Orc Army and draws a card for further options next step.

Cast Shelob's Ambush ({B}) using the single available black mana. It's a 🌟 synergy play: casting an instant will trigger Lord of the Nazgûl to create another 3/3 Wraith token (immediate board growth) while also giving a creature +1/+2 and deathtouch and creating a Food. This uses your mana efficiently on an instant that furthers the deck's midgame plan of generating tokens and applying pressure. I recommend targeting Lord of the Nazgûl with the buff to increase its immediate combat value (deathtouch makes it a much more threatening blocker/attacker next turn) and to maximize the value of the spell now. You cannot cast higher-cost spells this turn with only 1 mana, so this is the highest-impact play available.
