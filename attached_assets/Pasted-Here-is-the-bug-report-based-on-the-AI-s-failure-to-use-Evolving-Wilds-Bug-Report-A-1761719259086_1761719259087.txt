## Bug Report: AI Fails to Activate Zero-Cost Mana-Fixing Ability

**ID:** AI-LOGIC-001
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Open

### Summary

The AI correctly played `Evolving Wilds` on Turn 4 but then failed to activate its 0-cost sacrifice ability. This is a significant logical failure, as the AI left a "free" mana-fixing action unused, which is critical for an early-game setup.

The engine correctly handled the `Evolving Wilds` in a previous log (from `Nazgul Game File 7.txt`), so the activation logic exists. This bug is purely with the AI's decision-making.

### Observed Behavior

1.  **Turn 4, Main 1:** The AI drew `Scroll of Isildur`. Its hand contained `Evolving Wilds`.
2.  **Turn 4, Main 1:** The AI correctly identified `Evolving Wilds` as its priority land drop and played it.
3.  **Turn 4, Main 1:** The AI's *very next* action was to cast `Scroll of Isildur` for 3 mana.
4.  **Failure:** The AI completely skipped the opportunity to activate `Evolving Wilds` after playing it. It should have immediately activated the fetch land to get a basic land *before* deciding to cast any spells.

### Expected Behavior

The AI's decision-making should prioritize 0-cost, high-value actions like activating a fetch land immediately after it is played.

The correct sequence on Turn 4 should have been:
1.  **AI Action:** `playLand: Evolving Wilds`.
2.  **AI Action:** `activateAbility: Evolving Wilds` (to fetch a basic land, likely an `Island` to help cast `Counterspell`).
3.  **AI Action:** (Re-evaluate) Cast `Scroll of Isildur`.

This failure to act resulted in `Evolving Wilds` sitting uselessly on the battlefield for the rest of the game, delaying the deck's color-fixing and mana development.

### Recommendation

The AI's decision-making logic must be updated to ensure it scans for and prioritizes 0-cost activatable abilities (especially mana-fixing ones) immediately after a relevant permanent enters the battlefield.
