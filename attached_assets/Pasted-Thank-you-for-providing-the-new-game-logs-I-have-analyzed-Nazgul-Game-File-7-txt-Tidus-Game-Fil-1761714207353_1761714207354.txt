Thank you for providing the new game logs. I have analyzed `Nazgul Game File 7.txt`, `Tidus Game File 7.txt`, and `Frodo Game File 7.txt` to assess the impact of the code rework.

Here is my updated review and bug report.

### Executive Summary

The rework has partially fixed one of the original bugs, but the two most critical issues remain. The engine is now *attempting* to count lands, which is an improvement, but it is doing so inconsistently and is still ignoring other mana-producing permanents (like creatures).

Most importantly, the **critical bug** causing mana to desynchronize *within a single phase* is still present in all three logs. This remains the primary blocker, as the AI cannot make multiple valid plays in a turn.

### Progress Update: What's Fixed

* **Partially Fixed: Engine Ignoring Lands**
    * **Previous Bug:** The engine reported "0 lands" on every turn, regardless of the board state.
    * **Current Status:** The engine now correctly identifies that lands are on the battlefield. [cite_start]For example, in `Nazgul Game File 7.txt`, it correctly reports "1 lands = 1 mana available" on Turn 2 [cite: 29] [cite_start]and "2 lands = 2 mana available" on Turn 3[cite: 56]. [cite_start]The AI also correctly identifies this mana (e.g., "I have 2 total mana (U:1, B:1)" [cite: 51]). This is a significant improvement.

### Critical Issues Still Present

The core logic of the mana system is still not functioning according to the specification.

#### 1. (Critical) Bug: Mana Pool Contradiction / Not Persistent Within a Phase
This is the same critical bug from the previous report and is present in all three new logs. The engine does not correctly track the mana pool *after the first action*. After a colored spell is cast, the engine incorrectly tells the AI it has 0 colored mana, making all subsequent colored spells in the same phase impossible.

* [cite_start]**`Nazgul Game File 7.txt`:** On Turn 6, the AI successfully casts `Frantic Search` ({2}{U}), `Not Dead After All` ({B}), `Go for the Throat` ({1}{B}), and `Whispersilk Cloak` ({3})[cite: 120, 124, 128, 132]. [cite_start]Its very next decision in the *same phase* states: "You cannot legally cast any spell in hand: all five cards require colored mana (U or B) but the pool shows 0 colored mana available." [cite: 133]
* [cite_start]**`Tidus Game File 7.txt`:** On Turn 2, the AI successfully casts `Incubation Druid` ({1}{G}) and `Tromell, Seymour's Butler` ({2}{G})[cite: 349, 353]. [cite_start]Its next decision in the *same phase* states: "You have 3 total mana but 0 of every color available (no colored pips)." [cite: 355]
* [cite_start]**`Frodo Game File 7.txt`:** On Turn 5, the AI successfully casts `Cultivate` ({2}{G})[cite: 694]. [cite_start]Its next decision in the *same phase* states: "I have 3 generic mana but 0 colored mana". [cite: 702]

#### 2. (Critical) Bug: Failed Casts & AI/Engine Desynchronization
The AI and engine are still desynchronized on mana availability, leading to failed casts. This is likely a symptom of the engine failing to correctly calculate the *colors* of mana available.

* [cite_start]**`Frodo Game File 7.txt`:** On Turn 3, the AI (correctly) believes it has 3 mana (2 lands + 1 Bird) and can cast `Shortcut to Mushrooms` (cost {1}{G})[cite: 659, 665]. [cite_start]The engine repeatedly fails the cast: "Cannot afford Shortcut to Mushrooms"[cite: 658, 661].
* [cite_start]**`Frodo Game File 7.txt`:** On Turn 4, the AI (correctly) believes it has 4 mana (3 lands + 1 Bird) and can cast `Cultivate` (cost {2}{G})[cite: 678, 687]. [cite_start]The engine repeatedly fails the cast: "Cannot afford Cultivate"[cite: 677, 682].
* [cite_start]**`Nazgul Game File 7.txt`:** On Turn 4, the AI tries to cast its 5-cost commander, and the engine fails it with "Cannot afford commander (need 5, have 5)"[cite: 81, 85, 89, 92]. This "need X, have X" failure strongly implies a *color* mismatch, not a total mana mismatch.

### New Issues Found in Rework

The rework has introduced new bugs related to mana calculation.

#### 1. (New) Bug: Mana Engine Ignores Non-Land Permanents
The `Untap & Generate Mana` function is *still* not scanning all permanents. It is correctly counting lands but is **ignoring creatures with mana abilities**, a direct violation of the mana spec.

* **`Frodo Game File 7.txt`:**
    * [cite_start]On Turn 2, `Birds of Paradise` is cast[cite: 638].
    * [cite_start]On Turn 3, the untap step reports "1 lands = 1 mana available."[cite: 651]. It should be 2 mana (1 from `Fortified Village`, 1 from `Birds of Paradise`).
    * [cite_start]On Turn 4, the untap step reports "2 lands = 2 mana available."[cite: 670]. It should be 3 mana (2 lands + 1 Bird).
    * [cite_start]On Turn 5, the untap step reports "3 lands = 3 mana available."[cite: 691]. It should be 4 mana (3 lands + 1 Bird).

#### 2. (New) Bug: Mana Calculation is Inconsistent and Overcounting
The new `Untap & Generate Mana` function is wildly inconsistent and often *overcounts* mana.

* **`Tidus Game File 7.txt`:** On Turn 2, the board has one land (`Flooded Grove`). [cite_start]The untap step incorrectly reports "1 lands = 3 mana available."[cite: 342]. A single `Flooded Grove` should only produce 1 mana.
* **`Nazgul Game File 7.txt`:** On Turn 4, the board has 3 lands. [cite_start]The untap step incorrectly reports "3 lands = 4 mana available."[cite: 73]. [cite_start]On Turn 5, it reports "4 lands = 5 mana available."[cite: 94]. This suggests a flawed `mana = lands + 1` logic is being applied.

### Conclusion

The original bug (`MANA-001`) is **not resolved**.

1.  The `Untap & Generate Mana` function is still broken. It must be rewritten to iterate *all* permanents on the battlefield (Lands, Creatures, Artifacts), read their *parsed mana abilities* from the spec, and correctly sum the total pool of **each color**. (e.g., `{ W: 1, U: 1, B: 2, R: 0, G: 0, C: 2 }`).
2.  The main phase loop is still broken. It must be rewritten to maintain a *persistent* mana pool that is *decremented* after each spell is cast, so the AI can make multiple, valid plays in a single turn.
