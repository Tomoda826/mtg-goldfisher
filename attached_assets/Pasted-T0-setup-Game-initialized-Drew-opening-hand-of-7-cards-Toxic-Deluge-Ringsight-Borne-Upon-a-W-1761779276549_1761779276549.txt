Hand Evaluation
This hand fails the deck's must-have ramp requirement: you have only one land and no mana rock/signet. Many of your early engines here (Ringsight, Borne Upon a Wind, Storm of Saruman) require blue mana you don't have access to, and Nazg√ªl costs {2}{B} so you can't realistically cast your commander or establish the spellslinger engine early. Toxic Deluge and Reanimate are playable later but require more mana or a graveyard target. While Borne Upon a Wind does provide card draw, it's not castable without blue. Given the deck wants reliable early ramp/cantrips to generate tokens and protect the commander, this hand has no reliable path to do that in turns 1‚Äì3 and is therefore worth a mulligan.

Hand Evaluation
This hand satisfies the mulligan 'must have' criteria: you have a reliable ramp piece (Arcane Signet) and two lands (Island + Great Hall), plus early interaction (Swan Song) and a card draw spell (L√≥rien Revealed). While L√≥rien Revealed is a high-cost draw rather than a cheap cantrip, it still provides card advantage later or can be cycled for a land with islandcycling. Early game plan is functional: play a land turn 1, hold Swan Song to protect your early engine or disrupt opponents, develop Signet/lands on turn 2‚Äì3 to enable casting threats later. Witch-king is a respectable midgame threat and pairs with your token/voltron plan once you establish mana. The hand lacks cheap cantrips (Brainstorm/Opt-style), but it's playable and gives you ramp, protection, and a path to card advantage, so it can reasonably execute the deck‚Äôs gameplans in the first few turns.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Great Hall of the Citadel as the turn 1 land drop. It advances the mana plan (MANA) while also being high-value in Commander ‚Äî its {1},{T} mode can produce two mana specifically for casting legendary spells (helpful for Lord of the Nazg√ªl later). With 0 available mana I cannot cast any spells now, so putting a versatile land down is the most efficient play to enable future turns.

AI Strategic Decision
L√≥rien Revealed's Islandcycling {1} is usable from hand for the exact 1 colorless mana available. Use it to search an Island and put it into my hand ‚Äî this increases my land count/available mana next turn and is strictly better than passing. I cannot cast Arcane Signet (2), Orcish Bowmasters (1B) or Witch-king (5), and I don't have blue mana to cast Swan Song, so cycling is the most efficient engine/mana play this turn and follows the early-game goal of ramp/fixing.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
I have not played a land this turn and my actual available mana (1) cannot cast any spells in hand. Playing an Island is the highest-priority, mana-efficient play on Turn 2: it increases my available mana next turn so I can cast Arcane Signet or cheap spells/cantrips, follows the Early Game goals (ramp/fixing), and avoids passing with unused play. Either Island (hand index 1 or 5) is equivalent; I chose index 1.

Arcane Signet (card index 0) costs {2} and I have 2 total mana available (U:1, C:1), so I can cast it now. Early-game priority is to deploy mana rocks/ramp to hit my midgame windows (cast commander, enable follow-up plays). Other castable cards are Swan Song (index 2) but it has no valid target right now, and all other spells require black or more mana. Casting Arcane Signet uses my full mana efficiently and accelerates future turns, so it is the best play.

Play a land as the first priority this turn. We haven't used our land drop yet and adding an Island increases future colored sources (important for casting the commander and black cards later).

AI Strategic Decision
With 3 blue and 1 colorless available this turn, Swan Song (index 1) is the only spell in hand I can legally cast given color requirements. Per the play priorities, we should use available mana productively rather than pass. Swan Song is an instant interaction that buys us protection against a key opposing enchantment/instant/sorcery on or off the stack this turn; casting it now is the most mana-efficient, useful play available. If there is no immediate opponent spell to target on the stack, this is still the correct choice because it's the only castable card and using mana to advance the game state is preferred to passing with unused mana.

Per decision priority, take the land drop first. I have an Island in hand (index 3) and haven't played a land this turn. I currently have 3 mana (U:2, C:1) but no B available, so I cannot cast any of my black spells (Witch-king, Orcish Bowmasters, Mordor Muster).

With only 2 blue mana available and having already played a land and cast Dimir Signet earlier this turn, there are no legal, productive plays I can make now. All cards in hand require black mana (Orcish Bowmasters and Mordor Muster each require {B}; Witch‚Äëking and commander require much more total mana and black), so I cannot cast them. I also cannot (and should not) manually activate mana abilities here. Therefore the optimal play is to pass and retain options for opponent response and the next turn when the Signet can be used to ramp into my engine.

I have 2 blue mana available but no spells in hand that can be paid with blue (all three cards require black mana). There are no 0-cost or battlefield abilities I can or should activate now.

Casting him now advances the deck's primary plan and is mana-efficient ‚Äî waiting risks losing tempo.
