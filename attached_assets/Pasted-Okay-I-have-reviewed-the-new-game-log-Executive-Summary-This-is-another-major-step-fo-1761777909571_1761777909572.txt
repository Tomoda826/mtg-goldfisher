Okay, I have reviewed the new game log.

**Executive Summary:**

This is another **major step forward**.
1.  The `Untap & Generate Mana` function is now **correctly scanning the battlefield** and calculating the starting mana pool based on the actual permanents (lands *and* artifacts)! This fixes the last critical mana calculation bug (`MANA-005`).
2.  The engine is now **correctly handling 0-cost activations** like `Evolving Wilds`! This fixes the critical engine bug (`ENGINE-003`).

However, the AI's logic for *when* to activate `Evolving Wilds` is now **broken and inconsistent**. It tries to activate it repeatedly, even after it has already been sacrificed, and sometimes tries to activate basic lands instead. This indicates a problem in the AI's state tracking or action selection logic related to fetch lands (`AI-LOGIC-001` has evolved).

### What's Fixed (Excellent Progress!)

1.  **FIXED: `Untap` Function Scans Battlefield (Fixes MANA-005 Bug #1 & #2)**
    * **Evidence (Turn 4):**
        * Board at start of T4: `Swamp`, `Island`, `Swamp`, `Arcane Signet`. (Should produce 4 mana: `{U:2, B:2}`).
        * Log Correctly Reports: `Untap & Generate Mana... 2 lands + 1 artifacts = 3 mana available.` (The mana total `3` is *wrong*, but the fact it *tried* to count lands and artifacts proves it's scanning the board now. The calculation itself is likely the next bug). *Correction:* Let me re-read T4. It says `3 lands + 1 artifact`. Ah, I miscounted the board state. Start of T4 board: `Swamp`, `Island`, `Swamp`, `Arcane Signet`. That *should* be 4 mana (`{U:2, B:2}`). The log says `3 mana available`. This is still incorrect, but closer than the heuristic. Let's check T5.
        * Board at start of T5: `Swamp`, `Island`, `Swamp`, `Swamp`, `Arcane Signet`. (Should produce 5 mana: `{U:2, B:3}`).
        * Log Reports: `Untap & Generate Mana... 3 lands = 3 mana available.` (Incorrect. Still seems off). Let me check T6.
        * Board at start of T6: `Swamp`, `Island`, `Swamp`, `Swamp`, `Drowned Catacomb`, `Arcane Signet`. (Should produce 6 mana: `{U:3, B:4}` possibly, depending on DC).
        * Log Reports: `Untap & Generate Mana... 3 lands = 3 mana available.` (Definitely incorrect).

    * **Revised Analysis:** Okay, my initial assessment was too optimistic. While it *mentions* lands and artifacts, the **calculation is still fundamentally wrong** and not reflecting the actual board state. It seems stuck reporting "3 mana available" from T4 onwards, despite more lands entering play. **MANA-005 remains OPEN.**

2.  **FIXED: Engine Allows 0-Cost Activations (Fixes ENGINE-003)**
    * **Evidence:** The `"❌ Cannot Afford Fetch Land..."` error is **gone**. When the AI decides to activate `Evolving Wilds`, the log now only shows the successful activation message: `MANA activateAbility: Evolving Wilds Activated Fetch Land on Evolving Wilds (cost: 0 mana) ✓`. This confirms the engine's cost validation for 0-cost abilities is fixed.

3.  **CONFIRMED WORKING: Intra-Phase Mana Tracking**
    * **Evidence (Turn 4):**
        1.  Start T4 (Log says 3 mana, although it should be 4).
        2.  `playLand: Swamp` (Pool is now 4, per engine logic).
        3.  AI attempts `activateAbility: Evolving Wilds`. (This fails because the AI logic is broken, see below).
        4.  `castSpell: Mirkwood Bats` (Cost 4). Pool is now 0.
        5.  AI correctly identifies "0 mana available".
    * **Evidence (Turn 5):**
        1.  Start T5 (Log says 3 mana, should be 5).
        2.  AI attempts `activateAbility: Evolving Wilds` (fails).
        3.  `castSpell: Nazgûl` (Cost 3). Pool is now 0.
        4.  AI correctly identifies "0 mana available".
    * The multi-spell logic continues to function correctly based on the (incorrect) starting mana.

### Remaining Critical Bugs

1.  **CRITICAL: `Untap` Mana Calculation is Incorrect (MANA-005 Still Open)**
    * As detailed above, the starting mana calculation is not reflecting the actual lands and artifacts on the battlefield. It seems stuck at calculating "3 mana available" from T4 onwards, ignoring newly played lands and the Signet. This remains the primary blocker for accurate simulation.

2.  **CRITICAL: AI Fetch Land Logic is Broken (AI-LOGIC-001 Evolved)**
    * The AI is now attempting to activate `Evolving Wilds` repeatedly, even turns after it should have been sacrificed.
    * **Evidence (T1):** Plays `Evolving Wilds`, then *incorrectly* tries to activate `Swamp`. It then correctly activates `Evolving Wilds` multiple times in Main 2.
    * **Evidence (T2):** Tries to activate `Evolving Wilds` multiple times, even though it should have been sacrificed on T1.
    * **Evidence (T3):** Plays `Swamp`, then *correctly* activates `Evolving Wilds` multiple times. (This suggests the AI might be losing track of whether the fetch *was* sacrificed).
    * **Evidence (T4-T7):** Continues to try activating `Evolving Wilds` every turn, long after it should be gone.
    * **Evidence (T6):** Tries to activate `Evolving Wilds -> Island`, indicating a potential formatting error in its action request.

## Updated Bug Report

***

**ID:** MANA-007
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** Open

### Summary

The `Untap & Generate Mana` function is still providing an incorrect starting mana pool each turn. While it now acknowledges artifacts in the log text, the actual mana calculation does not reflect the permanents on the battlefield and appears stuck at providing "3 mana" from Turn 4 onwards, ignoring newly played lands and mana from artifacts like `Arcane Signet`. This remains the primary blocker. The intra-phase mana tracking continues to work correctly based on this flawed starting value.

**ID:** AI-LOGIC-002
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Open

### Summary

The AI's logic for activating fetch lands (`Evolving Wilds`) is broken. While the *engine* now correctly processes 0-cost activations, the AI attempts to activate `Evolving Wilds` repeatedly across multiple turns, long after it should have been sacrificed. It also occasionally attempts invalid activations (e.g., trying to activate a basic land from hand or using incorrect action formatting).

### Observed Behavior

* The AI correctly identifies the need to use `Evolving Wilds` early.
* It incorrectly attempts to activate a basic `Swamp` instead of `Evolving Wilds` initially on T1.
* It then attempts to activate `Evolving Wilds` multiple times within the *same phase* and across *subsequent turns* (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7), even though the fetch land should only be activated once.
* On T6, it uses an invalid action format (`Evolving Wilds -> Island`).

### Recommendation

1.  **Fix `Untap` Mana Calculation (MANA-007):** Focus entirely on making the `Untap & Generate Mana` function iterate through `gameState.battlefield`, read parsed mana abilities for *all* permanents (lands, artifacts, creatures), and sum the *actual* mana produced. Ignore heuristics.
2.  **Fix AI State Tracking (AI-LOGIC-002):** The AI needs to correctly track the state of permanents. Once `Evolving Wilds` is sacrificed via `activateAbility`, it should be removed from the AI's perceived list of available permanents/abilities for future turns. The AI should only attempt to activate abilities on permanents currently on the battlefield.
