This is an excellent log. Your analysis is spot on.

This log shows that the `MANA-REFACTOR-001` was a **major success**. You have successfully ripped out the old, broken mana pool logic from the `untap` step and replaced it with the new "Available Sources" model.

Here is my full take on this report.

### 1. What's Fixed (The Good News)

The old bugs we were hunting are gone.

* **FIXED! (`MANA-014`):** The `[untap]` step at the start of each turn is now correctly calling the new `ðŸ’Ž [PotentialPool]` logic. We see it being built correctly on Turn 1, Turn 2, Turn 3, etc.
* **FIXED! (`MANA-011`):** The broken "intelligent choice" logic is gone. The new system correctly identifies *all* mana abilities from dual-faced lands without making a premature "choice."
    * **Evidence (Turn 2):** `Tainted Isle` is correctly listed with *two* abilities:
        * `1: Tainted Isle (land) â†’ 1x{C}`
        * `2: Tainted Isle (land) â†’ 1x{U/B}`
    * **Evidence (Turn 5):** `Underground River` is also correctly listed with *two* abilities:
        * `4: Underground River (land) â†’ 1x{C}`
        * `5: Underground River (land) â†’ 1x{U/B}`

* **UNTESTED (but likely fixed):** `MANA-008` (ignoring artifacts)
    * The `cardBehaviorAnalyzer.js` log at the start *did* correctly parse `Sol Ring: {T}: Add {C}{C}.`.
    * However, `Sol Ring` was never drawn or played, so the `[untap]` step was never able to test if it would find the artifact. The `Artifact count: 0` log on every turn confirms this. Given that the land parsing is working perfectly, it's highly probable this is also fixed.

### 2. The New Problem (What's Broken Now)

Your observation is 100% correct: **The system can't *spend* the mana.**

The log shows a 10-turn game where no spells were cast, despite having plenty of mana and castable spells in hand (e.g., `NazgÃ»l` on Turn 5, `Countersquall` on Turn 8).

This is the next logical step in our refactor. We've changed the "mana database," but we haven't updated the "payment processor" that uses it.

* **Old Model (Broken):** A `canCast(spell)` function would look at a simple object like `manaPool = { U: 3, B: 3, C: 2 }`.
* **New Model (Current):** We now have a list of *abilities* (`availableSources = [ {source: 'Swamp', produces: ['B']}, {source: 'Tainted Isle', produces: ['C']}, {source: 'Tainted Isle', produces: ['U', 'B']} ]`).

The AI's "cast spell" logic is almost certainly still trying to look for the old `manaPool` object, finding it empty, and concluding it can't cast anything.

### 3. What's Next: `MANA-015`

Let's call this new bug `MANA-015: Update Mana Spender Logic`.

The next step is to refactor the part of the game engine that checks for `canCastSpell` and `spendMana`. This logic needs to be rewritten to:

1.  Take a spell's cost (e.g., `{2}{B}` for `NazgÃ»l`).
2.  Look at the new `ðŸ’Ž [PotentialPool]` list of available abilities.
3.  Solve the "payment problem": Can it find a combination of abilities from the list to pay the cost?
4.  This new function (let's call it `findOptimalPayment`) will be more complex, as it has to handle hybrid/phyrexian mana and make smart choices (e.g., "Use the `Swamp` for {B} and the `Tainted Isle` for {U} to cast `Countersquall`").

**In short: You fixed the mana *detection*. Now we need to fix the mana *spending*.**

This is fantastic progress. I'm ready for the next set of code.
