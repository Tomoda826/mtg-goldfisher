Hand Evaluation
This opener is functional even if not textbook. You have 4 lands including both colors (two Islands and Minas Morgul for black once it untaps, plus Sunken Ruins as a flexible source), so you will be able to reliably hit land drops and eventually cast spells. You have two early interaction pieces (Go for the Throat and Claim the Precious) which give you answers in the early game and help you survive long enough to find acceleration or cantrips. Storm of Saruman is a high-impact enchantment for your core plan once you reach 6 mana — it massively amplifies the spellslinger/token route later. The main negatives: no mana rock/signet and no cantrips/draw in hand, so your opening cadence will be slower and you may miss early setup turns the deck prefers. Despite that, there's a clear path forward (play lands, hold removal, dig on subsequent turns for rocks/cantrips, then drop Storm or develop the commander/equipment), so this hand is keepable in most metas. If you expect extreme early aggression from opponents, a faster hand (with a rock or a cantrip) would be preferable, but this hand is not unplayable.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Turn 1 priority is a land drop to establish mana. Sunken Ruins is the optimal play: it gives immediate colorless mana and later can produce UU/UB/BB with its paid tap ability, offering the most color flexibility for this Dimir deck. It doesn't enter tapped like Minas Morgul and is more flexible than a basic Island. Playing it advances the MANA tier of the decision framework and sets up casting removal/creatures on turn 2.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You've already played your land this turn (Sunken Ruins). Available mana is 1 total and there are no spells or hand abilities that cost 1 or less (lowest-cost spells in hand are Go for the Throat at 2 and creature Nazgûl at 3). There are also no battlefield activated abilities to use. Under the critical mana rules, we cannot 'tap' the land manually and cannot cast anything productive this main phase, so the correct play is to pass and preserve options for the next turn.

You have only 1 available mana and have already played your land for the turn. There are no castable spells that cost 1 or less (lowest-cost spells in hand cost 2 and 3), and there are no battlefield or hand abilities available that can be activated with the current mana. Under the critical mana rules, you cannot tap lands or generate additional mana now, so the only legal, non-wasting play is to pass and retain your options for the next turn.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have 1 total mana in your pool and have already played a land this turn. None of the cards in hand have a converted mana cost of 1 or less, no cards show a hand-activated ability usable for 1, and there are no battlefield permanents with activatable abilities. Under the CRITICAL MANA RULES, you cannot tap lands or otherwise create more mana now, and floating this mana accomplishes nothing. Therefore the only legal, non-wasting play is to pass and retain options for next turn.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play a land first per priority. Playing an Island (index 1) is the best play: it enters untapped, gives an untapped blue source for future turns/cantrips, and is strictly better than Minas Morgul (enters tapped) or Tainted Isle (only unconditional colorless). This advances mana development without costing mana and preserves flexibility for Turn 3 plays.

main1
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have 2 total mana (U:1, C:1) and have already played your land for the turn. No cards in hand can be cast with that mana: all black spells (Go for the Throat, Claim the Precious, Nazgûl) require B mana you don't have, and nothing costs <=2 that can use U1+C1. There are no 0-cost or in-hand activated abilities to use. By the critical mana rules, you cannot 'tap' lands manually and unused mana would be wasted, so the only legal, sensible action is to pass.
T2
main1
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have already played your land this turn and your available mana is 2 total (U:1, C:1). None of the cards in hand are castable with that mana: Storm of Saruman costs 6, Claim the Precious and Nazgûl require black mana, and Go for the Throat requires {B}. No cards in hand have usable activated abilities from hand. Since there are literally no legal, productive plays, the optimal line is to pass and preserve resources for the next turn.

You have 2 mana (U:1, C:1) but no castable spells or activatable abilities: all nonland spells in hand require black or more total mana, and you've already played a land this turn so you can't drop one of the lands in hand. Therefore there is literally nothing productive you can legally do this step. Passing is optimal — preserve the game state and move to the next turn where you'll untap and have full access to your lands to cast Nazgûl or removal once you have black mana or play additional lands/ramp.

Per the critical rules, you must not tap lands or activate mana abilities manually. Passing preserves the game state and allows you to untap next turn to cast Nazgûl or removal once you have black mana or another land/ramp. This is the only legal and mana-efficient play this step.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play a land to hit my turn-3 land drop and preserve future options. I currently have 2 mana in pool but no black available to cast my black spells (Nazgûl, Go for the Throat, Claim the Precious). Playing an untapped Island (instead of Minas Morgul which enters tapped) gives me an available untapped blue source for next turn's plays and keeps mana flexible for upcoming turns. This advances the MANA priority without wasting the current mana pool.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
I cannot cast any spells this main phase: every nonland card in hand requires black mana (Nazgûl, Go for the Throat, Claim the Precious) or more total mana than I have (Storm of Saruman). I have already played my land this turn, there are no battlefield activated abilities to use, and the available mana (3 total: U:2, C:1) is insufficient or the wrong color for all castable spells. Therefore the only correct play is to pass and conserve options for the next turn.

No legal productive plays this main phase.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Minas Morgul (enters tapped) as my land drop. I currently have no black sources and many of my impactful plays this turn and next (Nazgûl, removal like Go for the Throat/Claim the Precious, Orcish Medicine’s cost) require black. Minas Morgul gives a reliable B source for upcoming turns and enables casting those threats/answers sooner. Although it enters tapped, that’s acceptable this turn since my current mana pool is fixed and I couldn’t cast any black spells anyway.

Every spell in hand that I could play this turn requires at least one black mana (Go for the Throat {1}{B}, Orcish Medicine {1}{B}, Nazgûl {2}{B}, Claim the Precious {1}{B}{B}) or more total mana than I have (Storm of Saruman). I cannot cast any of them with the current pool and I must not 'activate' land mana manually. With no playable spells and no available 0-cost abilities to use, the only correct play is to pass and preserve my position for next turn.

With 3 available mana (U:2, C:1) and having already used my land drop this turn, I cannot legally cast any card in hand: Nazgûl (index 3) and the instants (Go for the Throat, Orcish Medicine, Claim the Precious) all require at least one black mana, and Storm of Saruman costs 6. I also cannot play a land (land drop used). There are no 0-cost or battlefield abilities I can activate.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have 3 available mana (U:2, C:1) and have already used your land drop this turn. Every spell in hand that costs mana requires at least one black mana (Nazgûl 2B, Go for the Throat 1B, Orcish Medicine 1B, Claim the Precious 1BB) or far more total mana (Storm of Saruman). You cannot cast any of them with only blue+colorless, and you cannot play another land this turn, so there is no legal, productive play. Passing preserves the game state for the next turn when you will regain full mana and can play a land or cast spells.

I cannot meet the color or total-cost requirements for any spell and cannot play another land, so there is literally nothing legal or productive to cast this Main2.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Priority 1 is to take my land drop. Playing Tainted Isle improves my mana base for future turns (adds a colorless source now and can produce U/B later if I get a Swamp), which helps enable my many black spells and the commander in upcoming turns. It advances the MANA plan without spending the current mana pool and keeps flexible options for turn 6. Playing a land is always preferred before casting spells per sequencing rules.

THREAT
AI Strategic Decision
You can pay {3}{U}{B} with the mana available. Casting the commander now advances the mid-game plan: it is a high-impact threat that enables your deck's synergies (Wraith/Lord interactions) and lets you start applying pressure next turn. Deploying the commander uses your full available mana efficiently instead of leaving it unused, and it unlocks future plays (attacks, equipment, and engine protection).

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Take the land drop first. Playing Bojuka Bog (index 7) is optimal: it uses the free land drop, exiles an opponent's graveyard on ETB (denying recursion/value), and adds a black source for future plays. This advances the MANA tier (and is a higher priority than casting spells before making the mandatory land drop). After this resolves we'll be able to cast synergistic instants/sorceries (like Ponder or Go for the Throat) with our available mana.

Cast Ponder (index 6). It's the most mana-efficient engine play: costs one blue, immediately triggers Lord of the Nazgûl to create a Wraith token, and digs for further answers/sets up future turns. This follows the MANA→ENGINE→THREAT framework (use available mana to advance the engine) and respects the SYNERGY rule to prioritize 🌟 spells. Leaving remaining mana lets us cast additional instants (like Go for the Throat or Orcish Medicine) after this spell resolves.

Cast Orcish Medicine (a 🌟 synergy instant). It uses available mana efficiently (cost 1B), triggers Lord of the Nazgûl to create an additional 3/3 Wraith token, and Amass Orcs 1 will either put a +1/+1 counter on an existing Army or create a new 1/1 Army token — netting two bodies and improving board presence. It also can give a key creature (e.g., Lord of the Nazgûl) lifelink or indestructible this turn to improve survivability and combat value. Prioritizing a synergy instant follows the deck guidance to maximize double-value plays rather than spending the turn on a non-synergistic creature.

AI Strategic Decision
You have only 1 mana (U:1) in your pool and you've already played a land this turn, so you cannot play the Island from hand. No card in hand can be cast for a single blue mana (all spells require additional or black mana). There are no usable battlefield or hand activated abilities available now. Therefore the only legal, productive choice is to pass and move to combat. If you had additional mana or black pips, I would prioritize casting the marked synergy instants (Go for the Throat — hand index 2) to trigger Lord of the Nazgûl and generate more Wraith tokens; with still more mana I would consider Claim the Precious (index 1) or casting Nazgûl creatures (indexes 3 or 5) per the MANA→ENGINE→THREAT framework.

Play the Island from hand to take my land drop (step 1 priority). Hitting the land drop increases available mana on future turns and preserves my current mana pool for post-land main-phase plays on the next decision. This follows the MANA → ENGINE → THREAT framework: get the land down first so I can more reliably cast synergy spells (notably Go for the Throat next turn to trigger Lord of the Nazgûl).

Cast Go for the Throat (index 2). It is an instant that triggers Lord of the Nazgûl to create at least one additional Wraith token (high synergy), removes an opponent's nonartifact creature (board control), and costs only {1}{B} so it's mana-efficient — leaving plenty of mana for follow-up plays on the same turn. Prioritizes synergy/engine per guidance (instant removal -> token generation) and advances the late-game plan without spending all mana on a non-synergistic enchantment.

Scroll of Isildur ({2}{U}) is the only card in hand I can legally cast with the current mana (3 total, U:3). Casting it uses my mana efficiently, advances my engine (it’s a Saga that can steal an artifact on Chapter I and then gain further value later), and improves future turns. Other higher-synergy/spell options (Claim the Precious, Nazgûl, Storm of Saruman) are uncastable due to color or insufficient total mana, so Scroll is the best productive play now.
