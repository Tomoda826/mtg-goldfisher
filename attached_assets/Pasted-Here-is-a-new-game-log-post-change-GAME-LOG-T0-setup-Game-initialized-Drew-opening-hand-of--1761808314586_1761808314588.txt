Hand Evaluation
This hand is keepable. It has 3 lands (counts as the 'extra land' ramp option from the playbook), two cheap card‑draw/filter spells (Night's Whisper and Mordor Muster) and interaction (Stern Scolding + Counterspell). That matches the Must Have checklist well enough: ramp (lands), card selection, and protection. Early game sequence is a little slow because there is no Sol Ring/Signet and Minas Morgul enters tapped, and Counterspell requires UU so you can't reliably hold up full counter protection on turn 2. Despite that, you have turn‑2 draw/filter to dig for actual ramp or the commander, and you have cheap interaction to handle early small creature threats. Given the deck's lenient mulligan guidance and the pathway to assemble the spell‑slinger engine (find Lord, find ramp/protection, then cast cheap instants/sorceries), this hand has a reasonable, playable plan and should be kept.

Play Island (index 3). Turn 1 priority is land drop + card-selection engine. Island lets me cast Brainstorm (U) or Stern Scolding (U) immediately on the next action and sets up blue access for the commander. Brainstorm is high value early for sculpting the hand, so prioritizing a basic Island over Minas Morgul (enters tapped) or Swamp (would only allow black one-drops but not the 1CMC draws) is the most flexible, mana-efficient play.

Cast Brainstorm (cost {U}) — it uses the available blue mana efficiently, advances the early-game plan by providing card selection and digging for ramp/protection/commander enablers, and is the highest-value engine play available this turn. Brainstorm helps sculpt the hand for future turns (protecting or enabling Lord of the Nazgûl, finding lands, or finding interaction) and avoids passing with unused mana.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
Available mana is 0 and I've already played my land this turn. There are no 0-cost spells or cards with activatable hand abilities (cycling/etc.) in hand, so I cannot legally or productively cast anything (commander also unaffordable). Passing preserves the game state and lets me use my mana next turn after untap. This follows the rule to not attempt to activate mana abilities or tap lands manually and to avoid wasting actions when no castable plays exist.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Priority first is a land drop. Underground River enters untapped and gives flexible access to U or B (at the cost of damage only when you tap for colored mana), which helps enable our Dimir color requirements for Lord of the Nazgûl and early counters. Playing this land advances our mana base without spending the 1 available blue mana in the pool (so we can keep responses available). This is the most mana-efficient play on Turn 2 and follows the MANA → ENGINE → THREAT framework.

You have 3 mana (U:2, C:1) but no black mana available, and you've already played your land this turn. None of the black spells in hand (Night's Whisper, Mordor Muster, Nazgûl) are castable due to lacking B. The only blue spells (Stern Scolding and Counterspell) require valid targets to cast — there are no opponent spells or legal targets right now — so casting them would be illegal or wasteful. There are no battlefield abilities to activate. Therefore the only correct play this step is to pass and preserve resources for the next turn.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Watery Grave from hand (card index 8). Step 1 = land drop. Watery Grave is the best play because it gives both blue and black fixing which is important for casting our UB threats (notably Nazgûl) and for future spells. I will pay the 2 life as it enters so it comes in untapped — that maximizes our tempo (we can then immediately produce the black/blue we need on the next decision to cast a spell). Minas Morgul enters tapped and Swamp is single-color; the dual land gives the most flexibility for the early curve and enables casting Nazgûl or other black cards next. This follows the MANA-first sequencing (establish ramp/fixing before committing to other plays).

AI Strategic Decision
Cast Arcane Signet (index 8) for 2. With 3 total mana (U:2, C:1), Arcane Signet is the highest-priority MANA play: it efficiently ramps/fixes into our UB colors, speeds out Lord of the Nazgûl on curve in subsequent turns, and follows the early-game guideline to establish ramp. It uses mana productively this turn instead of passing or holding countermagic; Signet’s future activation will provide the colored mana flexibility we need to cast Nazgûl or black spells next turn. This also preserves our 2 blue for potential responses on opponents’ turns after resolution.

No legal, productive plays with the mana/colors available. You've already played your land this turn, and your actual mana pool is 1 (U:1). Stern Scolding (index 1) requires a target creature spell and cannot be meaningfully cast now; all other spells in hand need black or more mana (Night's Whisper, Mordor Muster, Nazgûl) or UU (Counterspell) which you can't pay. Therefore the only correct action is to pass and wait for a playable window (or an opponent spell to respond to).

You have 1 mana (U:1) and have already played your land this turn. No card in hand is legally castable with that mana: Stern Scolding requires a target creature spell to be cast legally, Counterspell and Nazgûl need more/different mana, and the black spells require B. Per the critical mana rules, you should not try to tap lands or activate mana abilities manually. With nothing productive to cast, passing is the correct play and preserves your opportunity to hold priority for responses on opponents' turns.

All other spells/creatures require black mana or additional generic/colored mana (Counterspell, Night's Whisper, Mordor Muster, Nazgûl, commander). There are no battlefield activated abilities to use. Therefore the correct play is to pass and preserve priority to respond on opponents' turns.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play the Swamp (hand index 2). Land drop is highest priority — it advances our mana base so we can cast our black spells (Nazgûl, One Ring, Night's Whisper, Mordor Muster) on upcoming turns. With the current pool (U:4, C:1, B:0) we cannot legally cast any of our black spells anyway, and there are no valid targets for our blue instants, so playing a basic Swamp (which enters untapped) is the most efficient play. It preserves flexibility for turn 5 and avoids the downside of playing Minas Morgul tapped this turn.

Casting Lord of the Nazgûl (cost {3}{U}{B} = 5) is the highest-value play this turn. I have the required colors (U:4, B:1) and total mana (6), so I can cast the commander now. Putting Lord onto the battlefield advances the deck's primary mid-game plan: it is both an engine and a threat that creates Wraith value as I start casting cheap spells in subsequent steps/turns. It uses mana efficiently (5 of 6 available), accelerates toward the deck’s synergy-driven plan, and improves future turns by turning cheap instants/sorceries into board presence. One Ring to Rule Them All cannot be cast this turn (requires two black pips).

Follow the Decision Priority: take the land drop first to increase available mana sources and enable Minas Morgul's future activated ability. Even though there are high-synergy spells in hand, the framework explicitly prioritizes playing a land before casting spells. Minas Morgul also fits the MANA priority (ramp/utility), and leaving the rest of the turn to be evaluated after the land is placed is the correct sequencing choice.

Cast Night's Whisper ({1}{B}). It is a high-value, low-cost engine play that (1) triggers Lord of the Nazgûl to create a Wraith token and (2) draws two cards to refill resources. It uses only 2 of the 5 available mana and uses the single black pip you have, leaving plenty of mana to follow up after this spell resolves.

Cast Counterspell (U U). It uses available blue mana and is a high-impact instant that protects our board and denies an opponent threat. Importantly it triggers Lord of the Nazgûl's ability, creating an additional 3/3 Wraith token — double value (spell effect + token). This advances our mid-game engine (token generation and board protection) and follows the priority to favour 🌟 synergy spells. Counterspell is more flexible and reliable than Stern Scolding (narrower) and better tempo than leaving mana unused or playing a non-synergy Saga now.

AI Strategic Decision
Play Bojuka Bog as the mandatory land drop. Getting the land down follows the Turn 6 priority (land first → ramp/mana), potentially exiling an opponent's graveyard which can disrupt their recursion. It also preserves optimal sequencing: after the land is played we'll re-evaluate with the full board and still have 6 mana available to cast synergy spells (e.g., Mordor Muster) on resolution. Playing a land is higher priority than immediately casting non-land spells and avoids wasting the free land drop for the turn.

Cast Mordor Muster (index 0). It's the highest-value play this turn because it (a) triggers Lord of the Nazgûl to generate Wraith value, (b) draws a card (card advantage), and (c) is very mana-efficient (cost 2), leaving 4 mana to follow up. This advances our engine (tokens + draw) in the mid-game and preserves the option to cast Arcane Denial or a Nazgûl afterward. Arcane Denial is less urgent now since there's no immediate spell to counter; Mordor Muster gives immediate board and card benefit.

Available mana = 0 and I've already played my land this turn. Every card in hand requires mana to cast or to activate from hand, and there are no battlefield abilities I can legally use right now. The correct play is to pass main phase and proceed to combat — attack with the three ready creatures for 9 damage to apply pressure. This preserves resources and follows the critical mana rules (don't attempt to tap lands or activate mana abilities).

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play a land first per sequencing priority. Command Tower (index 5) is the best land to drop: it gives perfect color-fixing for future casts (One Ring, Nazgûl, Nazgûl Battle‑Mace and any commander interactions) and is the highest-value land in hand for mid/late game lines. Playing a land now preserves optimal sequencing and follows the deck's MANA-first rule. (Note: the displayed mana pool is already the available mana; playing the land does not require or consume that pool but must be done before further spells per the instructions.)

AI Strategic Decision
Cast Nazgûl (hand index 0). It's a cheap, high-value play (3 mana) that immediately triggers the Ring temptation, which will put +1/+1 counters on each Wraith you control — a huge immediate pump to the six 3/3 Wraith tokens and increases the pressure for commander damage. This advances the engine (token/pump synergy) and the threat level while leaving 5 mana available for follow-up plays on subsequent steps. It follows the MANA→ENGINE→THREAT priorities and uses mana efficiently this turn.

Cast One Ring to Rule Them All ({2}{B}{B}) — I have 5 mana (U3 B2) so I meet the color and total cost. This is the highest-value ENGINE play: the Saga will gain its first lore counter on entering and trigger its I chapter (The Ring tempts you). There is already a Nazgûl on the battlefield, so that ‘tempt’ will put +1/+1 counters on each Wraith you control, immediately strengthening our wide board and increasing our combat/lethal potential next turn. It advances the late-game engine more than just spending all mana on the Battle-Mace, and is more impactful than casting a single Nazgûl right now because it buffs the existing token army.

AI Strategic Decision
Play Great Hall of the Citadel as my land drop. Decision priority requires a land play first; this increases my available lands for future turns and enables Great Hall's second ability to help cast legendary spells (useful for my Nazgûl/commander line). After the land resolves I can use remaining mana next to cast Opt (to trigger Lord of the Nazgûl and draw) or cast Nazgûl/Battle-Mace on subsequent steps. Playing the land now preserves tempo and adheres to the MANA → ENGINE → THREAT framework.

Cast Opt (index 3). It costs {U} and is in-pool affordable (U:4). Opt is marked as a synergy card with Lord of the Nazgûl: casting it will trigger Lord to create another Wraith token while also letting me Scry 1 and draw a card. This is the highest-value, most mana-efficient play this step (ENGINE) — it advances card quality and increases board presence via the Lord trigger. It preserves flexibility for subsequent responses after it resolves.

Cast Nazgûl ({2}{B}) now. Its ETB will trigger the Ring tempting you, which (per its text) will put a +1/+1 counter on each Wraith you control. That directly advances the deck's late-game plan by beefing the entire Wraith army, increasing immediate board threat and future commander-combat potential. This is an efficient 3-mana play that leverages battlefield synergies (Lord of the Nazgûl + Wraith tokens) and makes the most of the current board state. It also preserves remaining mana for future plays next step (you used only one action this call as required).

THREAT
AI Strategic Decision
Casting Nazgûl Battle-Mace uses the full 5 mana pool now (no color restriction) and advances the gameplan by putting a high-impact, reusable piece of equipment on the battlefield. It is a threat that enables a strong mid/late-game line (equip to Lord/another Nazgûl next turn for menace + deathtouch + annihilator and later recur opponents' sacrificed permanents). This follows the MANA → ENGINE → THREAT framework by efficiently spending all available mana on a permanent that both increases board pressure and synergizes with sacrifice effects you may generate. It’s preferable to the 3CMC Scroll (underuses mana) and keeps the harder-to-cast 3BB Witch-king as a follow-up if needed.

AI Strategic Decision
Follow sequencing priority Step 1: take the land drop. Playing the Island from hand is the highest-priority, free action that improves future mana consistency and enables additional plays this turn on subsequent decisions. It preserves our current usable mana state and adheres to the rule to not pass with usable actions. After the land is played we can evaluate casting Witch-king (index 1) as a high-impact threat or Scroll of Isildur (index 0) as an engine on the next decision.

THREAT
AI Strategic Decision
Witch-king of Angmar is the highest-impact play this turn: it's a 5-drop threat that immediately advances our win plan (pressure and opponent disruption via its sacrifice trigger) and consumes our scarce black pips (we have only B:3). The card is castable with the current pool (total 10, needs {3}{B}{B}), so this uses mana efficiently and puts another evasive, punishing creature on board to close the game. Scroll of Isildur is a useful engine but is lower immediate impact and uses only blue/colorless, which we have abundance of — casting Witch-king first prioritizes threat density and color-efficiency. After this resolves we can re-evaluate remaining mana and plays.

Scroll of Isildur costs {2}{U} (3 mana) and I have {U}{U}{U}{U}{B} available, so I can cast it now (I meet the color requirement). This is an engine play that advances my late-game plan: it immediately enters as a Saga (adds a lore counter) and begins producing value (potentially gaining control of an artifact and later effects). Casting it uses mana productively rather than passing with idle mana, and builds my resource engine for subsequent turns. There are no other castable cards in hand and I cannot (per rules) manually activate mana abilities, so this is the best use of the available mana.
