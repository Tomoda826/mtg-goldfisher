Hand Evaluation
This hand is playable and meets the deck's minimums: you have a reliable land base (3 lands), a cheap draw/filter (Frantic Search) and interaction (Stern Scolding), plus a protection piece (Whispersilk Cloak) and a slow card-advantage engine (Palant√≠r). You lack explicit acceleration (Sol Ring/Signet/Talisman), so you‚Äôll be slower to reach the 5+ mana window for Lord of the Nazg√ªl, but the three lands plus Frantic Search (which untaps lands and digs) give a reasonable early game: T1 island into Stern Scolding or just a land drop, T2 begin sculpting with Frantic Search on T3 or cast Palant√≠r/Whispersilk Cloak as needed. Frantic Search also smooths draws and can fuel graveyard recursion later. Overall it‚Äôs not an ideal "fast" opener, but it‚Äôs good enough to execute the primary plans with some patience and careful sequencing.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play an Island (hand index 5). Land drop is priority #1 ‚Äî it advances our mana base and enables casting our blue interaction (Stern Scolding/Frantic Search) on upcoming turns and contributes to the two-color requirement for Lord of the Nazg√ªl. With no available mana in the pool and no mana rocks to cast, putting a land down is the most efficient use of this turn and follows the MANA-first sequencing guidance.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have already used your land drop and the only spell you can pay for right now is Stern Scolding (U), which requires a target (a creature spell with power or toughness 2 or less). There is no valid target on the stack in Main Phase 1, so casting it now is illegal/inefficient. All other spells in hand cost more than your available mana (1), so the only legal, sensible action is to pass and keep your instant available for a reactive play. Passing preserves card advantage and leaves you ready to hold up blue interaction on opponents' turns or to spend mana more productively on your next main phase.
T1
main1
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have 1 blue mana in the pool but no legal spell to cast: Stern Scolding (index 1) is the only card with a total cost ‚â§ available mana, but it requires targeting a creature spell with power or toughness 2 or less on the stack ‚Äî there is no such target in Main Phase 1. All other spells cost more than your available mana and you have already used your one land drop for the turn, so you cannot play another land. Passing preserves Stern Scolding for a reactive response on an opponent's turn (highest expected value) and avoids wasting mana or an illegal play.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
You haven't played a land yet this turn. Playing an Island increases your available blue sources for upcoming turns (enabling Frantic Search, protecting/playing commander sooner, and fitting the UB color base). A land drop is the highest priority (MANA) and uses no mana now, preserving your single blue for responses later. Playing Island rather than a Swamp keeps your mana flexible for blue spells this deck favors early.

I cannot play a land (already played a land this turn).

With nothing legally castable, passing is correct. Holding the mana does nothing (pool will empty), so passing preserves correct sequencing for next turn.

No legal, productive casts are available. Stern Scolding (U) is the only spell within the blue pip cost but it must target a creature spell and none exist, and all other nonland cards cost 3.

Follow Step 1 (land drop). Play the Island from hand to advance mana base and enable future blue plays (Frantic Search next turn, more reliable casting of commander and interaction). It's the highest-priority, mana-efficient play on Turn 3 and preserves the current mana pool for potential responses this turn. Playing a land also progresses the early-game plan toward hitting key mana counts on upcoming turns.

Cast Frantic Search (hand index 3). It uses my full available mana efficiently to generate card selection (draw 2, discard 2) and untaps up to three lands so I can immediately rebuild a mana base to cast another play this turn (for example Palant√≠r or Whispersilk Cloak). This advances the early-game engine goal (card quality and the ability to reach higher mana on the same turn) and preserves flexibility (instant-speed interaction and potential to find ramp/commander pieces). I have U:3 available which satisfies Frantic Search's {2}{U} requirement.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
You have not used your land drop this turn. Playing a Swamp (hand index 0) is the highest-priority play: it increases your colored mana options for future turns (you currently have 0 black sources and many key spells/your commander require B). You cannot cast any of your black-cost spells right now because your pool is U:3 with no B, so a land drop advances your ability to cast Call of the Ring, Mirkwood Bats, or Lord of the Nazg√ªl on upcoming turns. This follows the MANA ‚Üí ENGINE ‚Üí THREAT framework (secure mana first).

Cast Palant√≠r of Orthanc (3). It is the highest-value 'ENGINE' play available: it immediately advances card quality via recurring scry 2 each end step and helps find the pieces I need to hit the Turn 5 plan (Lord of the Nazg√ªl). It's colorless, mana-efficient (3 of my 4 available), and preserves my black pip for future plays (Call of the Ring, Mirkwood Bats, or commander). Following the MANA ‚Üí ENGINE ‚Üí THREAT framework, an ongoing filter is preferable this turn to dropping a 4-drop threat. I will be prompted again after this resolves to spend remaining mana.

Play Ponder (1U) as the first play this main phase to maximize card selection and improve subsequent sequencing. Per the Decision Priority (MANA ‚Üí ENGINE ‚Üí THREAT), engine (card selection/draw) is the highest-impact play available this turn: Ponder is mana-efficient, digs for answers (or protection/ramp/creatures) and preserves most of the available mana (casts for {U} leaving ~4 mana) so on resolution we can still cast a threat (Mirkwood Bats) or the commander. Casting Ponder first reduces sequencing risk (finds needed pieces) while using mana productively instead of immediately committing to the commander without information.

Mid-game priority is to deploy the engine ‚Äî Lord of the Nazg√ªl is the deck‚Äôs central threat and enables future synergy with Nazg√ªl/Wraith triggers.

Casting it on turn 6 maximizes downstream value (it enables triggered interactions and makes future cheap spells more impactful). I avoided casting Whispersilk Cloak or Nazg√ªl first because getting the commander down this turn is higher priority; if opponents respond, I can use remaining resources on my next step.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Priority rule #1: play a land if able. You have not played a land this turn and an Island is in hand (index 2). Playing the land increases available resources for later in the turn/next turn, fixes color requirements (important for casting U-cost spells like Surrounded by Orcs) and follows the MANA ‚Üí ENGINE ‚Üí THREAT framework. This preserves flexibility to cast synergistic spells (Surrounded by Orcs or Stern Scolding) after the land is played and keeps mana efficient.

Cast Surrounded by Orcs (index 4). It costs {3}{U} (4 mana) and we have U:5, B:2 available, so we can pay it. This is the highest-value play this turn by the MANA‚ÜíENGINE‚ÜíTHREAT framework: it is a synergy card (marked üåü) that (1) triggers Lord of the Nazg√ªl to produce token(s) when you cast the sorcery and (2) amasses Orcs 3 to create/advance an Army and then mills equal to that Army's power. It uses mana efficiently, advances our board by creating multiple creature tokens/Army counters, and builds toward the deck's late-game plan of overwhelming with tokens/Wraiths. Playing this now makes better immediate progress than casting a ramp piece or a single cheap instant.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Follow the Decision Priority (MANA ‚Üí ENGINE ‚Üí THREAT). With 3 total mana available, the highest-priority, most mana-efficient play now is to cast Arcane Signet (index 4) for ramp. It costs 2 and increases our available mana on future turns so we can both deploy threats (Nazg√ªl / Whispersilk Cloak) and have more flexibility to cast instants to trigger Lord of the Nazg√ªl. Stern Scolding (the best synergy card) can't be profitably cast now because there's no known legal target on the stack, so we prioritize ramp instead of casting a non-targeted instant. This uses mana productively and advances the late-game plan.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
I cannot cast any spells or play a land this turn with the actual mana available. I have 1 total mana (black) in my pool. Stern Scolding (index 0) requires a blue mana ({U}), Call of the Ring costs {1}{B} (2 total), Whispersilk Cloak costs 3, and Nazg√ªl costs 3. No battlefield abilities are available and I've already played a land this turn. Because nothing is legally castable or activatable with the current pool, the correct play is to pass.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
With only 1 total mana (B:1) in the pool, none of the cards in hand are legally castable: Stern Scolding requires U, Call of the Ring is {1}{B} (2), Whispersilk Cloak and Nazg√ªl cost 3. No 0-cost or battlefield abilities are available to activate. Per the decision priority (MANA‚ÜíENGINE‚ÜíTHREAT) and the critical mana rules, there is nothing productive to spend the current mana on, so the optimal play is to pass and retain resources for the next turn.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have only 1 mana (B:1) and have already played a land. None of the cards in hand are castable: Stern Scolding requires a blue mana (U); Whispersilk Cloak is 3; Call of the Ring is {1}{B} (2 total); Nazg√ªl is {2}{B} (3 total). There are no available battlefield activated abilities to use. Under the critical mana rules, you should not manually tap lands or activate mana abilities, so the only legal/proper action this step is to pass.

AI Strategic Decision
You have only 1 mana available (B:1). None of the cards in hand are castable: Stern Scolding requires a blue mana (U); Whispersilk Cloak is 3; Call of the Ring is {1}{B} (2); Nazg√ªl is {2}{B} (3). You have already played a land this turn and no free/0-cost abilities are available. Under the critical mana rules you cannot tap lands or activate mana abilities manually, so the only legal, optimal action is to pass and preserve game state for next turn. (If you get a blue or additional mana next turn, Stern Scolding is high priority because it triggers Lord of the Nazg√ªl.)
