Hand Evaluation
This hand meets the mulligan "must haves": it has 1–2+ mana sources (three lands), a cheap draw spell (Birthday Escape) and interaction (Reanimate qualifies as interaction/removal). It's functional for the deck's gameplan: you can lay lands and use Birthday Escape to dig for ramp/interaction/protection, and Reanimate gives a path to immediately deploy a threat off an opponent's graveyard. Witch-king is a high-cost finisher that fits your reanimate/late-game plan. The hand lacks immediate Sol Ring/signet-level ramp or haste equipment to deploy a commander on turn 2–3, but it is still playable and flexible enough to assemble the spellslinger pieces or find protection in the first few turns. Given the lenient keep policy, this hand is good enough to pursue the deck's win conditions.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Command Tower (hand index 6) as the turn 1 land. Land drop is the highest priority (MANA) and requires no mana to play. Command Tower gives perfect color-fixing for our Dimir commander and will let us cast our early U/B spells and the commander more smoothly on subsequent turns. With 0 available mana we cannot cast any spells this turn, so playing the most flexible land is optimal.

AI Strategic Decision
No legal casts or plays remain. You've already played your land this turn, and the only spells in hand that cost 1 require colored mana (Birthday Escape needs {U}, Reanimate needs {B}). Your available mana is 1 colorless, so you cannot pay those color requirements or cast the commander. Per the critical rules, you also cannot 'tap' lands or activate mana abilities manually. With nothing productive to do this main phase, passing is optimal.

AI Strategic Decision
You've already played your land this turn. Available mana is 1 colorless with no colored mana (U:0, B:0), so you cannot pay the colored pips required for Birthday Escape (U) or Reanimate (B). There are no activatable hand abilities or colorless-cost spells you can cast. Under the critical mana rules, you may not tap lands or otherwise generate additional colored mana now, so the optimal play is to pass and preserve tempo for turn 2.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play a Swamp (hand index 1) as the turn-2 land drop. Land drop is top priority (MANA) and expands future options toward the deck’s UB gameplan (Reanimate, Mirkwood Bats, and Lord of the Nazgûl require black). Choosing a Swamp over Island biases our mana toward casting Reanimate or the commander on upcoming turns. This uses the required land drop instead of passing and keeps options open for turn 3 plays.

AI Strategic Decision
Use 1 blue to cast Birthday Escape and draw a card — this is the highest-value, low-cost ENGINE play available. It advances card quality early (dig for commander, ramp, or answers) while using mana efficiently instead of passing. Reanimate is a tempting THREAT play, but its value is highly dependent on graveyard content we don't know; drawing a card is a safer, higher-expected-value play this turn. After this resolves we will be able to reassess with remaining black mana and new information.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play the Island from hand as my turn's land drop. Step 1 of sequencing is to play a land if available. Putting the Island onto the battlefield maximizes access to blue next turn (helpful for Counterspell/Swan Song and for casting Lord of the Nazgûl later) while not spending any of the 2 mana currently in my pool. This preserves my available {U}{B} to cast spells after this land drop on subsequent decisions and advances tempo without wasting resources.

AI Strategic Decision
Sauron's Ransom ({1}{U}{B}) uses my full available mana (U2, B1 = 3) and is an instant — the best main-phase use of my resources this turn. It advances an early-game engine (library manipulation / dig) without committing a permanent I might wish to protect, and leaves my cheap reactive spells (Counterspell, Swan Song, Reanimate) available for later windows. Casting an instant now also gives opponents something to respond to and fits the deck plan of generating value with spells. I already made my land drop (Island), so spending all 3 mana here follows the MANA→ENGINE→THREAT priority and avoids passing with unused mana.

Cast Sauron's Ransom (index 1). It uses the full available mana (3 total: U2, B1 -> {1}{U}{B}), fits the MANA→ENGINE→THREAT priority by converting unused mana into card-selection/digging value, and is an instant so it remains flexible and doesn't commit a permanent. This advances the early-game plan (find answers/pressure/commander) while preserving Counterspell and Swan Song as reactive mana sinks. Reanimate (index 0) is a reasonable backup but relies on creature cards in graveyards; keeping countermagic in hand is important on Turn 3 so Sauron's Ransom is the higher-value proactive play.

Cast Sauron's Ransom ({1}{U}{B}) using all available mana (U2, B1). It's an instant that digs/selects cards (ENGINE), uses my full mana efficiently on Turn 3, and is the highest-value proactive play available. Instant-speed interaction also aligns with the deck's synergy priority (instants are preferred because they both advance board resources and can trigger commander-based synergies later). This play preserves the cheap countermagic (Counterspell and Swan Song) as reactive answers while improving future turns.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play the Swamp from hand first. A land drop is highest priority (MANA) and increases available mana for future turns so we can cast our commander or larger threats on curve. Playing the land this turn preserves the full 3-mana pool for next turn (plus the extra land), keeps options open, and follows the guidance to never pass with an unused land play available. It's strictly better than spending this turn's 3 mana on a 3-drop now because the board is empty and setting up mana accelerates midgame goals (casting Lord of the Nazgûl in the next turn window).

THREAT
AI Strategic Decision
Cast Nazgûl ({2}{B}) this main phase. It is the highest-value, synergy play available: it's a threat with deathtouch and an ETB that "tempts the Ring," giving immediate synergies with our commander plan and future Wraith/token interactions. At 3 mana it is mana-efficient on turn 4 and leaves flexibility to follow up on remaining mana next (you'll be prompted again after this spell resolves). Casting Nazgûl advances our board state and sets up midgame combos rather than spending all 4 mana on a vanilla 4-drop. It also preserves instants (Counterspell/Swan Song) for protection on subsequent steps if needed.

Priority rule #1: take my land drop first to increase available mana for this turn and future turns. Playing a land advances the MANA tier (enables casting higher-cost spells like Witch-king or Mirkwood Bats next turn and gives flexibility to hold countermagic). This follows the Decision Priority (MANA → ENGINE → THREAT). After the land is played I will be called again to cast spells with the now larger mana base.

Cast Mirkwood Bats for {3}{B} (4 total). This uses all 4 available mana efficiently to put a flying threat/engine onto the battlefield that will profitably synergize with the deck's token plan (it punishes opponents whenever you create Wraith tokens later). It preserves the instants in hand (Brainstorm, Counterspell, Swan Song, Sauron's Ransom) for future turns when you aim to cast Lord of the Nazgûl or sequence instants to generate Wraiths immediately. On turn 5 this is the highest-impact, mana-efficient play that advances both board presence and the deck's midgame engine.

Engine play: Cast Brainstorm (cost {U}) to dig for lands/answers/commander. I can't cast Lord of the Nazgûl (need 5 mana) and I want to maximize card quality this turn rather than use countermagic proactively. Brainstorm is the highest-value, cheapest engine play — it uses 1 of my 2 blue mana to potentially find a land or key piece while leaving reactive cards (Counterspell/Swan Song) in hand for opponents' plays on their turns.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Take the land drop first to advance mana base and follow the decision priority (always play a land if available). Playing Rivendell increases future mana consistency (gives an additional U source) and enables its battlefield ability later (Scry 2) once a legendary creature is in play — this helps set up casting Lord of the Nazgûl on a subsequent turn. Keeping this turn's options open is more valuable than spending the current 3 mana on a one-off spell; it adheres to the deck plan to ramp/enable mid-game plays. Also preserves reactive instants (Counterspell, Swan Song, Arcane Denial) in hand for opponents' turns.

Cast Consider (index 5). This turn my priority is ENGINE: dig/filter to find the commander, ramp, or interaction to enable a stronger midgame. Consider is an efficient instant cantrip (Surveil 1 + draw) that improves card quality and can set up graveyard targets, while costing only {U}. It uses available colored mana productively without burning a valuable counterspell (Arcane Denial/Counterspell/Swan Song) in my main phase. After this resolves I'll be prompted again and can follow up with another play using remaining mana if appropriate.

Orcish Medicine is the only playable card with the current mana (2 total, B:2). Casting it uses mana efficiently, advances the board (amass Orcs 1 creates or grows an Army token) and grants a beneficial combat ability. I will give lifelink to Mirkwood Bats so my single flying attacker can both deal damage and gain life this turn; alternatively I could give indestructible to a more important creature if I expected removal. This play follows the ENGINE priority (token generation + creature utility) and avoids passing with unused mana.

AI Strategic Decision
Casting Lord of the Nazgûl uses the full available mana (5) and meets its color requirements (U and B). This advances the late-game plan by putting the commander on board as a major threat and enables immediate synergy with the cheap instants/sorceries in hand (you can follow up after this resolves to generate Wraiths and grow the board). There is no land to play and no higher-priority mana or engine play available, so deploying the commander is the most mana-efficient, impactful action this turn.
