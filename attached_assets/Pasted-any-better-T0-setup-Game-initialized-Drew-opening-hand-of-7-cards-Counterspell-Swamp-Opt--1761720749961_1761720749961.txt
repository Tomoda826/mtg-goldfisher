Hand Evaluation
This hand is playable and fits the lenient keep criteria. You have 3 lands (two immediate sources of B and Evolving Wilds for fixing), a cantrip (Opt) and interaction (Counterspell), plus an early black instant (Orcish Medicine). You lack an immediate blue source, so Opt/Counterspell aren‚Äôt castable on turn 1, but Evolving Wilds will allow you to find an Island later and your land count lets you hit Nazg√ªl by about turn 3 (or cast Orcish Medicine on turn 2 with two swamps). There are no mana rocks, but the three lands compensate for early ramp. This hand can reasonably reach the midgame to try for the token-swarm or voltron plan, so keep it rather than mulligan.

Play Evolving Wilds as the turn 1 land drop. As a fetch land it immediately and for free lets us sacrifice it to put a basic land (a Swamp) onto the battlefield tapped, giving us a guaranteed basic for future casts and fixing our colors while preserving Watery Grave for later. This adheres to the Decision Priority (land first ‚Üí use fetch ability) and advances our early-game plan to enable casting our black spells in subsequent turns.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Watery Grave (index 6) as the land drop. Getting a dual (U/B) now is the highest-value play for turn 2 because it enables our blue interaction (Counterspell/Opt) and accelerates our ability to cast the commander or cast spells on curve in the coming turns. When Watery Grave enters you may pay 2 life to have it enter untapped ‚Äî do so so the land is immediately usable next turn. After this land drop, we will also activate Evolving Wilds (a 0-cost battlefield ability) to fetch a basic (likely a Swamp or Island) if we want additional fixing; that activation will be done immediately when prompted. This follows the MAJOR priority: Land Drop -> MANA (ramp/fixing) and sets up casting Opt/Counterspell and the commander sooner.

AI Strategic Decision
Orcish Medicine ({1}{B}) is castable with the current pool (2 total, B:2) and is marked as a high-value synergy play. Casting it (1) triggers Lord of the Nazg√ªl to create another 3/3 Wraith token, (2) lets me amass Orcs 1 (creating or growing an Army token), and (3) provides an instant protection/lifegain option. I will target Lord of the Nazg√ªl with lifelink to convert the upcoming attack into life and to keep the commander safer. This uses mana efficiently and advances the engine (more bodies + counters) rather than spending both mana on Glamdring this turn.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Evolving Wilds has a 0-cost activated ability (sacrifice to fetch a basic land) which is a free, mana-zero play that improves my future turns. I cannot cast any spells (0 mana available) and I've already played my land, so activating Evolving Wilds now is the highest-value, no-cost action per the free-actions priority. It increases my land count (helps cast Nazg√ªl(s) or hold up Counterspell on later turns) and uses a play opportunity rather than passing. This follows Step 2 (free actions) and the MANA-first sequencing guidance.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
I must pass because I have 0 available mana, I've already played my land this turn, and there are no battlefield activated abilities available to use. None of the cards in hand are castable (Counterspell costs UU, each Nazg√ªl costs 2B, Glamdring costs 2, and Tainted Isle is a land). With no legal, productive plays, passing is the optimal choice.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
I have 0 available mana and have already played my land this turn. None of the cards in hand are castable (Counterspell costs UU, each Nazg√ªl costs 2B, Glamdring costs 2; Tainted Isle is a land and I can't play a second land). There are no other free/battlefield activated abilities available to use. Passing is therefore the only legal, non-wasting play this step.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have 0 available mana and have already played a land this turn, so none of the cards in hand (Counterspell {U}{U}, Nazg√ªl {2}{B}, Glamdring {2}, or the land Tainted Isle) are castable. There are no zero-cost battlefield abilities available that would produce meaningful value right now, and activating mana abilities is prohibited by the rules here. Passing preserves the turn and lets you untap next turn with mana to cast high-value, synergy plays (Counterspell to trigger Lord of the Nazg√ªl, or Nazg√ªl to buff your Wraiths).

main2
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have 0 available mana and have already used your land drop this turn, so no card in hand is castable and there are no meaningful 0-cost activated abilities to use. Passing preserves resources and lets you untap next turn with full mana to cast high-value, synergy plays (preferably Counterspell to trigger Lord of the Nazg√ªl and create additional Wraiths, or cast a Nazg√ªl to buff existing Wraiths). Activating mana abilities or attempting to play a land is illegal/ impossible this step.
