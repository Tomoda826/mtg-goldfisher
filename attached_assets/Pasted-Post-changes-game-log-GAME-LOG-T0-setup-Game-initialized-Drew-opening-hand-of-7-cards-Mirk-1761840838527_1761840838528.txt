mulligan
Hand Evaluation
This hand has 3 lands (fine) but fails the deck's must-have criteria: no fast mana (Sol Ring/Signet/etc.) and no cheap cantrip/draw (only Lórien Revealed is a high‑cost draw spell). All spells in hand are high CMC creatures (Mirkwood Bats, Ringwraiths, Witch‑king) or an expensive sorcery, so there is no way to meaningfully advance the Lord/Storm token engine or set up protection/voltron in the early turns. While not absolutely dead (you can cast things later), there is no reasonable early path to accelerate, filter, or protect the commander—exactly what this archetype needs—so mulliganing for a hand with fast mana and at least one cheap cantrip is the correct play.

Hand Evaluation
This hand is playable and meets the lenient mulligan standard. You have two lands (so reliable early mana), a cheap cantrip (Consider) to sculpt/find key pieces, and Lightning Greaves to protect your commander when you get it out. It lacks the ideal fast mana artifact, but it isn't a dealbreaker — you can still get the engine online: turn 1 play a land and cast Consider to dig for ramp, protection, or your commander; turn 2 play the second land (Drowned Catacomb will enter untapped if you sequence lands correctly) and either deploy Greaves or hold mana to start deploying spells or the commander next turn. Stern Scolding is situational but can stop an early aggressive creature, and Scroll of Isildur is a value piece you can develop. Overall there is a clear path to the deck's spell‑matter/token plan and voltron setup, just slightly slower without a turn‑1 artifact ramp.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play the Swamp (hand index 2). Turn 1 land drop is highest priority to enable future plays; the Swamp comes into play untapped and guarantees a usable black source next turn for spells like Consider/Ponder or the commander. Drowned Catacomb would enter tapped on T1 (since no Island/Swamp is already on board), so Swamp is the more mana-efficient opening and best advances the MANA goal.

No legal casts or activations are available.

You have 1 black mana in the pool but none of the cards in hand are castable with that mana: Consider, Ponder, and Stern Scolding require blue; Scroll of Isildur needs 3 mana including U; Lightning Greaves needs 2 colorless; Drowned Catacomb is a land and you've already played your land for the turn. Per the critical mana rules, you should not attempt to tap or activate mana abilities manually, and you should not pass with spendable mana only if nothing is castable. Since there is literally nothing legal to cast or activate, passing is the optimal play. Preserve your resources for your next turn when you can play Drowned Catacomb and cast card-filtering cantrips (Consider/Ponder) to smooth draws or accelerate into your commander/engines.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Drowned Catacomb as the Turn 2 land drop. This is the highest priority (MANA) play: it gives a second land, enters untapped because we already control a Swamp, and immediately provides access to U/B for casting Consider/Ponder/Stern Scolding or Orcish Bowmasters next turn. Playing the land advances the early-game plan (fixing colors and ramp) and avoids passing with unused resources.

ENGINE
AI Strategic Decision
Play an early cantrip to smooth draws and advance the engine. Consider (U) is an instant that surveils 1 and draws a card, giving card selection and immediate info while preserving interaction options this turn. It follows the deck's early-game guidance to prioritize cheap card selection over committing a 2-drop creature now. After this resolves we can reassess and likely cast Orcish Bowmasters or Lightning Greaves with the remaining mana.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play the Swamp from hand. You have not taken your land drop this turn and playing a land is highest priority (MANA) to accelerate future turns. Getting a third land on the battlefield (Swamp + Drowned Catacomb + this Swamp) means next turn you can cast 3CMC spells like Lord of the Nazgûl or hold open options for both black and blue spells. This adheres to the turn‑3 early game goal: secure mana sources before deploying engines or threats. Note: do not attempt to 'tap' lands for mana now — the provided available mana reflects the current pool and this land must be played first to increase future available mana.

ENGINE
AI Strategic Decision
Orcish Bowmasters (index 4) is the best play this turn: it develops a permanent on-curve (2 mana), provides an ETB engine that will punish opponents for drawing and generates incremental value, and has flash so it can act as a reactive threat later. This uses mana efficiently and advances the early-game engine plan more than playing Greaves or just cantripping. After this resolves, with 1 blue mana still available I'll prioritize Ponder next turn (or immediately if prompted) to smooth draws.

THREAT
AI Strategic Decision
Cast Lightning Greaves ({2}) — it uses available mana efficiently (2 of 3), advances the board by adding a resilient permanent, and gives a valuable protection piece for the deck’s plan. Greaves can immediately be equipped (equip {0}) to an existing creature (e.g. Orcish Bowmasters) on the next prompt, protecting key creatures or the commander from removal and enabling surprise attacks. This fits the mid‑game goal of getting protection online while still leaving room to follow up with a cantrip (Ponder) on the next action. It’s higher impact this turn than holding mana or casting a one‑off instant/counter that has no target now.

Cast Nazgûl ({2}{B}) using the full 3 mana pool (U:1, B:2 available).

Can't reasonably cast the commander or larger engines this turn, so putting a 3‑cmc body on the battlefield is the most efficient play.

AI Strategic Decision
Priority 1 is a land drop and I have Island in hand (index 5). Playing the land advances my mana base for future turns (gets me to 4 lands), fits the MANA → ENGINE → THREAT framework, and follows the deck guidance to not pass with available plays. It preserves my current mana-efficiency plan: with an additional land untapped next turn I'll be closer to casting Lord of the Nazgûl or Storm of Saruman. Playing a land now is more impactful than spending U on a cantrip because securing the land drop increases ramp and future options.

Cast Ponder (1U). This is the highest-value, most mana-efficient ENGINE play: it smooths and draws, improving future turns and helping find Storm of Saruman or the commander.

Keeping the bigger plays for after resolving Ponder preserves sequencing flexibility and information.

Priority is ramp (MANA). I cannot play a land this turn and have 3 mana available, so casting Sol Ring (CMC 1, colorless) is the most efficient use of mana to accelerate future turns toward casting Lord of the Nazgûl and enabling Storm of Saruman / engine turns. Sol Ring immediately improves mana production on my next turn and adheres to the guidance to advance board state rather than pass. Scroll of Isildur is a viable engine play but is slower to impact the board than immediate ramp; Stern Scolding is purely reactive and situational.

Cast Lord of the Nazgûl now (cost 5). This advances the late‑game plan by putting your engine on board. Importantly, you can pay the commander using extra black for generic (for example U1 + B2 + C2 = 5), leaving one blue in the pool. That lets you immediately follow up (when asked again) with your 1‑mana instant Stern Scolding to trigger Lord's spell‑cast benefits and begin producing Wraiths this turn. Casting the commander first maximizes long‑term value (engine + threat) and enables an immediate synergy play with the remaining mana.

You have only 1 black mana in your pool (B:1). None of the cards in hand are castable with that mana: Stern Scolding needs U, Scroll of Isildur and Nazgûl need more total mana, Extract and Storm are much more expensive. You also have no land in hand to play. There are no 0‑cost or activatable battlefield/hand abilities available to use. Therefore the only legal, productive choice this step is to pass.

AI Strategic Decision
With only 1 mana available (B:1) and no lands in hand, there are no spells or activated abilities I can legally cast or activate this main phase. None of the cards in hand match the available color (Stern Scolding requires U) or total mana. I cannot play a land (no land in hand) and I must not attempt to manually tap lands or activate mana abilities. Therefore the only legal, non‑wasting play is to pass and preserve the game state for the next turn. Ideally I want to cast Stern Scolding or Extract from Darkness to trigger Lord of the Nazgûl, but both are uncastable this turn.

No legal plays available with the actual mana pool. I have only 1 total mana (B:1) and no lands in hand. All cards in hand require more mana and/or different colors (Stern Scolding requires blue; Extract from Darkness, Scroll of Isildur, Storm of Saruman, and Nazgûl all cost more than 1 and/or need other colors). There are also no usable activated abilities. Under the critical mana rules I cannot tap lands or activate mana abilities manually, so the only correct action is to pass and retain the current board state.

AI Strategic Decision
Cast Treason of Isengard ({2}{U}) because it is a high-value, mana-efficient engine play that also triggers Lord of the Nazgûl. It will Amass Orcs 2 (pumping/creating Orc counters on Orcish Bowmasters) and can return an instant or sorcery from the graveyard to the top of the library — both permanent board improvement and card advantage. This advances the late‑game plan (build tokens/creatures and grow board) and uses available colored mana (U requirement) cleanly. It also follows the SYNERGY rule to prioritize spells that trigger Lord of the Nazgûl over non-synergistic plays.

AI Strategic Decision
Scroll of Isildur ({2}{U}) is a legal, high-value ENGINE play this turn: it costs 3 and I have 4 total (U2 B2), so I can pay its color requirement and use mana efficiently. It establishes an ongoing engine (Saga) that immediately advances board development (the I chapter triggers on entry to potentially gain control of an artifact) and provides card/board advantage over subsequent turns. Stern Scolding (index 1) is marked as a synergy pick but is not currently castable because it requires a creature spell on the stack as a target. Extract from Darkness and Storm of Saruman are too expensive this turn. Casting Scroll now follows the MANA→ENGINE→THREAT framework (prioritizing engine) and leaves flexibility for follow-up plays on the next prompt.

Mordor Muster (index 5) is the best single play this step.

Cast Arcane Denial (hand index 5). It uses the full 2 mana available (U:1, B:1 combined total 2), so no mana is wasted. Arcane Denial is marked as a synergy spell and will trigger Lord of the Nazgûl to create another 3/3 Wraith token while also providing a versatile counterspell/economic card-advantage effect (you draw a card at next upkeep). Stern Scolding (index 0) is also a synergy option but costs only 1 mana and would leave 1 unused mana this turn; therefore Denial is the more mana-efficient, higher-impact play. There are no lands in hand to play, and no higher-priority mana or threat plays available that fit the current pool.
