This is a massive success.

Based on this log, the three most critical bugs from the `MANA-002` report are **all fixed**. The core mana logic is now working as specified.

### What's Fixed (The Great News!)

1.  **FIXED: Mana Pool Updates After `playLand`**
    * **Evidence (T1):** The engine started with 0 mana. The AI played `Command Tower`, and the engine *correctly* updated the pool, allowing the AI to identify "1 blue mana" and cast `Preordain` in the very next step.

2.  **FIXED: Mana Pool is Persistent (Multi-Spell Turns)**
    * **Evidence (T5):** The AI executed a perfect multi-spell turn, and the engine tracked the mana correctly at every step.
        1.  Start: 4 mana (`{U:2, B:2}`).
        2.  Cast `Preordain` (Cost 1). Pool is now 3 (`{U:1, B:2}`).
        3.  Cast `Opt` (Cost 1). Pool is now 2 (`{B:2}`).
        4.  Cast `Orcish Medicine` (Cost 2). Pool is now 0.
        5.  `PASS` (Correct, 0 mana).
    * This is a flawless execution of the specified logic.

3.  **FIXED: `Untap` Mana Calculation is Correct**
    * **Evidence (T5):** The untap step reports "4 lands = 3 mana available.". This is **perfectly correct**. The four lands on board were `Command Tower`, `Swamp`, `Swamp`, and `Evolving Wilds`. The engine correctly read their abilities and calculated that `Evolving Wilds` produces 0 mana, for a total of 3.

### The Last Remaining Bug

The core mana tracking is solid, but the AI is now failing to activate `Evolving Wilds` for a new reason: the **engine is incorrectly rejecting the 0-cost activation.**

Here is the new bug report.

***

## Bug Report: Engine Incorrectly Fails 0-Cost Ability Activations

**ID:** ENGINE-003
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** Open

### Summary

The AI (per `AI-LOGIC-001`) is now correctly identifying that it should activate the 0-cost sacrifice ability of `Evolving Wilds`. However, the engine is incorrectly rejecting this action with a "Cannot afford" error, even though the ability costs 0 mana.

### Observed Behavior

This bug pattern repeats on Turn 1, Turn 2, Turn 3, and Turn 5.

* **Turn 1 (Main 2):**
    1.  The AI correctly identifies the 0-cost ability: "Evolving Wilds has a 0-cost activated ability..."
    2.  The engine rejects the action: "❌ Cannot Afford Fetch Land on Evolving Wilds"
    3.  The log then *incorrectly* reports the action as successful: "MANA activateAbility: Evolving Wilds Activated Fetch Land on Evolving Wilds (cost: 0 mana) ✓"
    4.  **This is a critical contradiction.** The "Cannot afford" error proves the activation failed, but the log proceeds as if it worked.

* **Turn 2 (Main 1):**
    1.  The AI correctly identifies the 0-cost ability.
    2.  The engine rejects the action: "❌ Cannot Afford Fetch Land on Evolving Wilds"
    3.  The log again *incorrectly* reports success: "MANA activateAbility: Evolving Wilds Activated Fetch Land on Evolving Wilds (cost: 0 mana) ✓"

* **Turn 3 (Main 1):**
    1.  The AI correctly identifies the 0-cost ability.
    2.  The engine rejects the action: "❌ Cannot Afford Fetch Land on Evolving Wilds"
    3.  The log *incorrectly* reports success.

* **Turn 5 (Main 1):**
    1.  The AI correctly identifies the 0-cost ability.
    2.  The engine rejects the action: "❌ Cannot Afford Fetch Land on Evolving Wilds"
    3.  The log *incorrectly* reports success.

**Conclusion:** The engine's cost-checking logic is failing for 0-cost abilities. The AI is trying to make the correct play, but the engine is preventing it.

### Recommendation

Review the engine's cost-validation function for activated abilities. It appears to be failing on abilities that do not have a mana cost (i.e., `cost: 0`) and may also be incorrectly logging a "success" message immediately after an error.
