Hand Evaluation
This hand is playable and has a clear path forward even though it's not ideal. It has 2 lands (Underground River and a Swamp) and at least one cheap interaction (Go for the Throat) plus additional mid/late game engines (Extract from Darkness, Decree of Pain, Witch-king). It fails the “must have a mana rock/signet” guideline, so you’ll be slower to deploy the commander, but the hand still allows productive early turns: turn 1 Underground River, turn 2 you can cast Go for the Throat (or hold removal), and you can stabilize into midgame reanimation/sweep plays. Sam’s Desperate Rescue and Extract provide recursion paths that fit the deck’s reanimation/tempo win conditions later, and Decree/Witch-king give strong mid-to-late game tools. Overall: not the nuts (no acceleration/cantrips), but not unplayable by the lenient mulligan rules. Keep and try to dig for acceleration or the commander on subsequent turns.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play a land as Turn 1 priority to advance the MANA plan. The Swamp (hand index 6) is the safest play: it provides guaranteed black for the deck's dimir needs without the 1-damage downside of Underground River. This preserves life and sets up turn-2 plays (most likely casting Sol Ring or deploying further ramp/engine pieces). Playing a land now follows the Decision Priority (Land Drop → MANA) and avoids unnecessary life loss early.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Cast Sol Ring for {1}. This uses the full available mana to establish immediate ramp (fits the Turn 1 MANA priority), enabling a much stronger turn 2 (e.g., casting Lord of the Nazgûl earlier or additional ramp/interaction). Sol Ring is the most mana-efficient play available and advances the deck's early-game plan.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
Available mana is 0 and I've already taken my land drop this turn. There are no affordable spells (all cards in hand cost at least 1) and there are no usable battlefield activated abilities right now. Sol Ring is already on the battlefield (will provide ramp next turn), so the correct play this step is to pass and preserve tempo into the next turn.
T1
main1
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
Available mana is 0 and I have already played my land this turn. There are no 0-cost activated abilities to use and no spells I can legally cast with 0 mana. Sol Ring is already on the battlefield (from the recent action) and its mana ability cannot be manually activated now per the critical rules. Therefore the only correct play is to pass and preserve tempo into the next turn when Sol Ring and the Swamp will provide usable mana.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
Available Mana = 0 and I've already played a land this turn. No spells in hand cost 0 and there are no battlefield or hand abilities I can legally activate that would advance the board (per critical rules I may not manually activate mana abilities like Sol Ring or tap the Swamp). Therefore the only legal and optimal play is to pass and retain tempo into the next turn when Sol Ring + Swamp will provide usable mana.
T1
main2
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
Available mana = 0 and I've already played a land this turn. No spells in hand cost 0 and there are no activatable non-mana abilities I can legally use from hand or battlefield. Underground River is a land but I cannot play another land this turn. Therefore the optimal play is to pass and retain full flexibility for turn 2 (and use available mana then). Passing avoids illegal or wasteful attempts to activate mana abilities and follows the early-game plan to ramp/play on curve when mana is available.

T2
main1
MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Great Hall of the Citadel as the land drop. This advances the MANA plan: Great Hall's secondary ability (pay 1, tap to add two mana for legendary spells) helps enable an earlier cast of our commander Lord of the Nazgûl, which is the deck's engine. Keeping Underground River in hand preserves a flexible colored source for near-term black/blue needs (and avoids taking 1 damage now). No useful spells to cast this turn, so prioritizing the land drop and future ramp is optimal.

main1
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
No legal productive plays are available this main phase. I already played my land this turn, so I cannot play Underground River. I cannot cast Lord of the Nazgûl or Witch-king (insufficient total mana). Go for the Throat (index 1) requires a target nonartifact creature and there are no creatures on the battlefield, so it is not a legal cast. Sam's Desperate Rescue (index 3) requires returning a creature from my graveyard, but I have no creature in my graveyard, so it's not a legal cast either. There are no battlefield abilities to activate and no other beneficial plays, so passing is optimal to avoid wasting resources and to keep options for the opponent's turn.
T2
main1
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
No legal productive plays are available. Land drop has already been used this turn, and none of the spells in hand are currently castable or have valid targets: Witch-king (5), Extract from Darkness (5) and Decree of Pain (8) exceed the 4 total mana available; Go for the Throat has no creature target; Sam's Desperate Rescue requires a creature in my graveyard (none). Playing Underground River would cost the land drop and deal 1 damage if played now; keeping it in hand preserves flexibility and avoids the damage. Passing preserves mana options for responses on opponents' turns and follows the priority to not waste resources.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
No legal, productive plays are available this main2. Land drop has already been used, so I cannot play Underground River this turn (and I prefer to keep it in hand to avoid its 1 damage unless I need the fixing). Go for the Throat is castable mana-wise but has no valid target on the battlefield. Sam's Desperate Rescue requires a creature in my graveyard (none). Witch-king, Extract from Darkness, and Decree of Pain exceed available mana. I also have no battlefield activated abilities to use. Given those constraints, passing preserves my available mana for responses on opponents' turns and avoids making a suboptimal play.
T2

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
No playable spells or actions this Main2: cannot play a land (land drop already used), Go for the Throat has no legal creature target, Sam's Desperate Rescue needs a creature in my graveyard, and the remaining spells/commander exceed available mana. Passing preserves my available mana for responses on opponents' turns and avoids making a suboptimal play (also keeps Underground River in hand to avoid its 1 damage until I need the fixing).

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Priority 1 is to play a land. Playing Underground River (index 0) gives the best color flexibility (access to U or B) for enabling future Lord of the Nazgûl / blue-black spells. There are no relevant creature targets to use Go for the Throat now, and no other playable spells with the current mana, so a land drop advances the deck's early-game plan without wasting resources.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have already played your land this turn and there are no legal, productive spells to cast with the current mana. Go for the Throat and Sam's Desperate Rescue both require legal targets (a nonartifact creature on battlefield or a creature card in your graveyard) which do not exist right now. All other spells (Witch-king, Extract from Darkness, Decree of Pain) exceed available mana. There are no activatable battlefield abilities. Therefore the optimal play is to pass and preserve resources for the next turn.
T3

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
No legal, productive plays are available. You have already played your land this turn, and the only spells you could pay for with 3 mana are Sam's Desperate Rescue ({B}) and Go for the Throat ({1}{B}), but each requires a legal target (a creature card in your graveyard or a nonartifact creature on the battlefield) which do not exist. Higher-cost spells (Witch-king, Extract from Darkness, Decree of Pain) exceed available mana. There are no battlefield abilities to activate. Following the mana/engine/threat framework and the critical mana rules, passing preserves resources for the next turn rather than attempting an illegal or targetless cast.

AI Strategic Decision
No legal, productive plays available this step. You have 3 mana (B:1, C:2) but: Go for the Throat (1B) has no valid target (no nonartifact creatures on battlefield), and Sam's Desperate Rescue (B) requires a creature card in your graveyard (none). All other spells in hand cost more mana than available and you have already played your land for the turn. Casting is illegal or impossible, so the optimal play is to pass and preserve resources for next turn.
T3
main2
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
No legal casts or activations are available that use the mana. Go for the Throat (index 0) requires a nonartifact creature target — none exist. Sam's Desperate Rescue (index 2) requires a creature in your graveyard — you have none. All other spells in hand cost more mana or the wrong colors. You've already played your land for the turn, so playing the Island is illegal. Per the critical rules, do not attempt to activate mana abilities manually. Therefore the only correct play this step is to pass and preserve decision-making for next turn.
