Hand Evaluation
This hand is playable and fits the deck's practical mulligan criteria. You have 3 lands (good tempo) plus two ramp artifacts (Dimir Signet and Talisman of Dominance) and Lightning Greaves as protection ‚Äî that covers the deck's core early needs even though you lack a cheap cantrip. With this you have a clear 3‚Äì4 turn plan: turn 1 play a land, turn 2 cast one of the 2-mana artifacts (or Signet + pass), turn 3 accelerate into your commander or cast Greaves to protect an early Lord. Greaves counts as the interaction/protection requirement. Missing a cantrip slows digging, but the multiple fast artifacts give a reliable path to get Lord of the Nazg√ªl out soon and start generating Wraiths. The lands are functional (Drowned Catacomb is normally untapped here because you have a Swamp), and the pain land/ Talisman lifeloss is minor for the tempo this hand provides. Because it has a definite path to the primary win conditions (early Lord + protection + ramp) and is not cramped or mana-flooded, keep.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play a land is Turn 1 priority (Step 1). Playing Island (hand index 7) is the best play: it advances mana development (enables future blue plays), and it makes Drowned Catacomb enter untapped later if drawn/played next turn. With 0 available mana I can't cast any spells or artifacts this turn, so taking the land drop preserves flexibility and sets up smooth early turns toward the deck's engine (Lord of the Nazg√ªl / signets).

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You have 1 available mana (U:1) and have already played your land for the turn. There are no spells or hand abilities that cost {1} or less to cast/activate this main phase, and all playable permanents in hand are CMC 2+ or lands (which can't be played again). Battlefield-only abilities (e.g., equip, signet tap) cannot be used from hand. Therefore the only legal/optimal action is to pass and preserve tempo for turn 2. Next turn we'll play another land (Swamp/Underground River/Drowned Catacomb) and look to cast a mana rock (Dimir Signet / Talisman) or Lightning Greaves to accelerate/protect the Lord plan.

AI Strategic Decision
I have already played my land for the turn and my actual available mana is 1 (U:1). There are no cards or hand abilities that cost {1} or less to cast/activate this main phase ‚Äî all permanents in hand are CMC 2+ or lands (already used land drop). Per the critical rules, I must not try to 'tap' lands or activate battlefield mana abilities from hand, and passing is the only legal/optimal choice. This preserves flexibility for turn 2 when I can play a second land (preferably Drowned Catacomb or Swamp) and cast a 2-cost mana rock (Dimir Signet/Talisman) or Lightning Greaves to advance the deck's engine/protection plan.

You have only 1 mana (U) and have already used your land drop. No card in hand has a casting cost of 1 or less, and battlefield mana abilities cannot be activated from hand.

AI Strategic Decision
Available mana is 1 (U). No nonland card in hand has a casting cost of 1 or less and the commander costs 5. You've already played your land for the turn, so you cannot play another land. Mana abilities on cards in hand cannot be used from hand. Therefore there is nothing legal or productive to cast/activate this main phase ‚Äî passing preserves the option to use 2 mana on turn 2 (e.g. cast Dimir Signet/Talisman/Greaves) and follows the CRITICAL rules to not manually activate mana abilities.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Drowned Catacomb (hand index 6). Land drop is priority: it increases future mana options and enables casting Dimir spells on turn 3. Drowned enters untapped because we control an Island, giving an available U/B source next turn without costing tempo. This advances the ramp/curve plan and preserves our single available {U} for no immediate casting (we can't cast any 1-cost spells that help more than a land drop).

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Turn 2 priority is ramp. Casting Dimir Signet for {2} uses available mana efficiently and accelerates future turns by providing U/B fixing ‚Äî it synergizes with the deck plan to hit key plays (lord/engine/protect) earlier. Lightning Greaves and Talisman are playable alternatives, but Signet is the best long-term mana fixer for a two-color spells-matter engine and sets up stronger turns 3‚Äì4.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Swamp from hand as the turn's land drop. Getting an additional guaranteed black source is the most flexible and reliable early play for this Dimir deck ‚Äî it helps enable future Lord of the Nazg√ªl casts and makes UB costs easier to pay. Playing a land advances the MANA plan without wasting cards or mana and preserves options for casting a 3CMC sorcery/instant or a 2CMC artifact later this turn (if you choose to act again).

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Cast Talisman of Dominance for ramp. This is the most mana-efficient play that advances the deck‚Äôs early-game plan: it adds an additional permanent that will provide the extra black/blue source needed to reliably cast Lord of the Nazg√ªl on turn 4 and accelerates future plays. Spending 2 of the 5 available mana on a ramp artifact maximizes long-term tempo and keeps options open. Other cards (Greaves, Ringsight, Snap) are less impactful right now: Greaves is protection but not ramp, Ringsight‚Äôs search is best used when a legendary creature is on board, and Snap currently has no good target.

THREAT
AI Strategic Decision
Cast Lightning Greaves ({2}). It uses mana efficiently this turn to advance the board by adding a permanent that directly enables the deck's early-game plan: it protects our commander (Lord of the Nazg√ªl) when we can cast it next turn and can be equipped for {0} immediately for immediate haste/shroud later. Greaves is high-impact early protection and preserves flexibility (we can still cast Lord on turn 4 and put Greaves on it). This follows the principle of doing something useful with available mana rather than passing.

AI Strategic Decision
You have already played a land this turn. Available mana is insufficient to cast Ringsight (needs 3 total including U and B) or Witch-king (6). Snap (index 3) is the only spell with a total cost ‚â§ your available mana and with the correct colors, but it requires a target creature and there are no creatures on the battlefield, so it cannot be cast. No battlefield activated abilities are usable without casting a permanent first, and the Underground River is a land in hand (cannot be activated). By the mana/use rules, there are no legal, productive plays this main phase, so passing is optimal rather than attempting illegal or wasteful actions.
T3

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
No legal, productive plays are available this main phase. You have already played your land this turn, so Underground River cannot be played. Witch-king (6) and Ringsight (3) exceed the available mana. Snap (2, {U}) would be mana-legal but requires a target creature ‚Äî none exist ‚Äî so it cannot be cast. Battlefield abilities on the Underground River cannot be used from hand, and you must not manually activate mana abilities. Given the Critical Mana Rules and the Decision Priority, passing is optimal rather than attempting an illegal or wasted action.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Underground River as the mandatory land drop. Hitting the land drop preserves future mana flexibility and enables the land's U/B mana ability on subsequent turns (it must be played first). This follows the opening priority (land ‚Üí ramp/engine) and keeps options open to cast Lord of the Nazg√ªl or Witch-king next turn. Playing the land now also improves color fixing for upcoming casts and avoids wasting a turn with fewer lands.

AI Strategic Decision
Casting Lord of the Nazg√ªl (cost {3}{U}{B}) is the highest-value play: it gets the engine online so subsequent instants/sorceries (Preordain, Snap) will generate Wraith tokens and accelerate our mid-game plan. We have the required colors and 7 mana available, so this is fully affordable and advances the deck's stated Turn 4 goal of establishing the engine. After this resolves, we'll have 2 mana left to cast a cheap cantrip (likely Preordain) on the same turn to start drawing and trigger Lord once summoned.

Ringsight (1UB, cost 3) is playable with the current pool (U:2 B:2) and is the highest-value ENGINE play this turn. It's a üåü synergy spell so casting it will trigger Lord of the Nazg√ªl to create another 3/3 Black Wraith while also letting you search for a card that shares a color with a legendary creature you control (card selection/refill). This advances the deck's engine and uses mana productively on Turn 4. Snap is also a valid synergy play, but with no known immediate target and being an instant you'd usually keep it as interaction ‚Äî Ringsight gives immediate card advantage while generating the Lord trigger.

That advances the deck's midgame engine more than deploying a non-synergistic permanent, and is preferred per the SYNERGY rule. Using Ringsight now keeps Snap (an instant-speed interaction) in hand for future responses.

Snap is very mana-efficient (2 mana) and advances the engine while also removing a blocker/threat. Using Snap now preserves bigger plays for after responses and follows the deck's mid-game plan of generating tokens via cheap instants/sorceries. If beneficial, Snap's untap effect may return lands/artifacts to availability later when the stack resolves; regardless, casting it now uses mana productively and leverages battlefield synergies.

THREAT
AI Strategic Decision
No land to play. With 10 mana (U4 B6) both 6-cost creatures are castable. Ringwraiths (hand index 1) has an immediate ETB effect: -3/-3 to a target creature and potential bonus life loss if it's legendary. That immediate removal/tempo swing is higher value this turn than casting Witch-king (which only gives attacking value next turn). It uses available mana efficiently, answers a potential blocker/threat now, and keeps future turns flexible. Color requirement (BB) is satisfied.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You cannot cast the only card in hand (Witch-king, Bringer of Ruin costs {4}{B}{B}, but available mana is only 4 total with only {B}:2). There is no land in hand to play (Has Played Land This Turn = false but no land listed in hand) and there are no available battlefield activated abilities to use. With no productive plays available this main phase, the correct play is to pass and move to combat to attack with the two ready creatures (6 potential damage).
T6
main1
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
You cannot cast Witch-king (cost {4}{B}{B}) with only 4 total mana and only {B}:2 available; there is no land in hand to play and no 0-cost/other castable actions. Per the critical mana rules, do not try to tap lands or activate mana abilities manually. With no productive main-phase play, the optimal move is to pass to combat and attack with the two ready creatures (6 damage). This preserves available mana for responses on opponents' turns and follows the deck's midgame plan to apply pressure while waiting for a proper window to cast higher-cost synergy threats.

AI Strategic Decision
I cannot cast Witch-king (cost {4}{B}{B}) because I only have 4 mana available (U:2, B:2) ‚Äî total mana < spell cost, even though color requirement could be met. There are no other cards in hand or battlefield activated abilities I can pay for now, and I don't have a land in hand to play. Per the critical rules, I must not attempt to manually activate mana abilities and should not waste actions; passing is the correct play.

AI Strategic Decision
You cannot legally cast Witch-king (cost {4}{B}{B}) because your ACTUAL total available mana is 4 (U:2, B:2) ‚Äî less than the required 6.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Bojuka Bog (hand index 1) as the mandatory land drop first. This follows the Decision Priority (land drop before spells), preserves available mana for future turns, and immediately exiles a graveyard to disrupt opponents' recursion (valuable late-game hate). Bojuka Bog entering tapped is an acceptable trade for the ETB effect and keeps our options open on the next step/turn. We must choose one action now; casting Witch-king can be done on the next decision after this land resolves if appropriate.

THREAT
AI Strategic Decision
Cast Witch-king, Bringer of Ruin for 6 (we have the required BB and total mana). This uses mana efficiently (6 of 7), advances the late-game plan by deploying a high-impact threat with flying and an attack trigger that will remove an opponent's smallest blocker on attack. It increases offensive pressure going into combat and synergizes with the deck's plan to finish the game via commanding threats. Casting now (main1) is optimal rather than passing and leaves 1 mana open for responses or flash interactions later.

Cast Go for the Throat ({1}{B}) now. It is affordable (total mana 8, B available) and is marked üåü so it triggers Lord of the Nazg√ªl to create a Wraith token in addition to removing an opponent's nonartifact creature. This advances the engine (token generation) while removing a threat, uses mana efficiently, and follows the deck's late-game plan to amass tokens/pressure. Pick the highest-priority nonartifact opposing creature as the spell's target (the biggest immediate threat or the creature that most prevents our plan).

AI Strategic Decision
Cast Toxic Deluge (index 0). It's a high-value, synergy play: Lord of the Nazg√ªl triggers when you cast an instant/sorcery, so casting Deluge gives an immediate extra Wraith token while also giving the option to clear problematic creatures. Casting it for X=0 (pay 0 life) uses only {2}{B} of the available mana, preserves our current board (avoids killing our own creatures/commander), and still gains the triggered token ‚Äî efficient progress toward the late-game plan. If opponents have heavy boards, we can instead choose a larger X to clear them (we have the life/mana to do so), but with incomplete info the safest, mana-efficient, synergy-maximizing line is to cast it now.
