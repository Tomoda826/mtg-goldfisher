This is a "two steps forward, one step back" log.

We have definitively **fixed** the major bugs we were hunting (`MANA-017` and `MANA-008`), which is a huge victory. The start-of-turn parser is now correctly handling complex lands and artifacts.

However, this update has revealed two new, distinct bugs: one that was hiding (`MANA-016` is still present) and one new regression (`MANA-018`).

Here is my full analysis.

### 1. What's Fixed (The Good News)

The start-of-turn (`[generateMana]`) function is now robust and correct, which was our primary goal.

* **FIXED! (`MANA-017`): Start-of-Turn Land Parsing**
    * The `[generateMana]` function is no longer failing to parse your non-basic lands.
    * **Evidence (T10):** `9: Bojuka Bog (land) â†’ 1x{B}`. This is the exact card that failed in the previous log, and it is now working perfectly.
    * **Evidence (T5):** `3: Sunken Hollow (land) â†’ 1x{U/B}`. This was also parsed correctly at the start of the turn.

* **CONFIRMED FIXED! (`MANA-008`): Artifact Mana**
    * We finally have a log where `Sol Ring` is in play, and it works exactly as expected.
    * **Evidence (T6 JIT):** After casting `Ringsight` and `Sol Ring`, the *next* JIT rebuild (for casting `PalantÃ­r`) correctly identifies `Sol Ring` as an available source: `0: Sol Ring (artifact) â†’ 2x{C}{C}`.
    * **Evidence (T7 Untap):** The start-of-turn parser also finds it: `6: Sol Ring (artifact) â†’ 2x{C}{C}`.

### 2. What's Still Broken / New Bugs

#### BUG `MANA-016`: JIT Pool Update Failure (Still Broken)

This bug is still present. The JIT (Just-In-Time) mana pool rebuild that runs *after* a `playLand` action is failing for *some* of your non-basic lands.

This proves that your **start-of-turn parser** (which is now fixed) and your **JIT parser** (which is still broken) are two different pieces of code that need to be unified.

* **Evidence (Turn 4):**
    1.  **Start of Turn:** The pool correctly has 4 mana abilities.
    2.  **Action:** The AI plays `Sunken Hollow` (a conditional ETB land).
    3.  **JIT Rebuild:** The console logs `ðŸ’Ž [PotentialPool] Building available sources...`
    4.  **Failure:** The log *after* that build (the `ManaSolver` for `Scroll of Isildur`) reports `Available sources: 4 abilities`.
    5.  This is the bug. After `Sunken Hollow` resolved, the JIT pool should have found **5** abilities, but it failed to find the new land.

* **Contrasting Evidence (Turn 5):**
    1.  The AI plays `Sunken Ruins` (a vanilla non-basic).
    2.  The JIT rebuild runs.
    3.  The `ManaSolver` for `castCommander` correctly reports `Available sources: 6 abilities` (the 5 from untap + 1 from Sunken Ruins).
    4.  This shows the JIT parser works for simple lands but fails for conditional-ETB lands like `Sunken Hollow`.

#### BUG `MANA-018`: Regression - `Commander's Sphere` Disappears

This is a new and critical regression. The `start-of-turn` parserâ€”while fixed for landsâ€”is now **dropping `Commander's Sphere` from the mana pool** starting on Turn 7.



* **Evidence (T4, T5, T6):**
    * On the untap steps for these turns, the `[PotentialPool]` list correctly includes `Commander's Sphere`.
    * `T6 Pool: ... 5: Commander's Sphere (artifact) â†’ 1x{W/U/B/R/G}`. (This is correct)

* **Evidence (T7, T8, T9, T10):**
    * On Turn 7, `Sol Ring` has been added to the battlefield.
    * **The Bug:** The `[generateMana]` function on T7 *fails to find `Commander's Sphere`*. The `PotentialPool` list only contains the 6 lands and `Sol Ring`.
    * This failure repeats on T8, T9, and T10. `Commander's Sphere` is never seen by the start-of-turn parser again.

* **Hypothesis:** The logic you added to the start-of-turn parser to correctly find `Sol Ring` (in `cardBehaviorAnalyzer.js` perhaps?) has accidentally broken the parser for `Commander's Sphere`. It's likely an issue in your artifact-parsing loop.

### Summary & Next Steps

1.  **Celebrate:** The land and `Sol Ring` parsing at the start of the turn is **fixed**. The core refactor is holding.
2.  **`MANA-016`:** Copy the (now working) land-parsing logic from your **start-of-turn** `[generateMana]` function and paste it into your **JIT** `rebuildPool` function. This should fix the JIT failures on conditional lands.
3.  **`MANA-018`:** Investigate the start-of-turn artifact parser. Why does it correctly find `Sol Ring` but *stop* finding `Commander's Sphere` on the *exact same turn* `Sol Ring` is first present (T7)?
