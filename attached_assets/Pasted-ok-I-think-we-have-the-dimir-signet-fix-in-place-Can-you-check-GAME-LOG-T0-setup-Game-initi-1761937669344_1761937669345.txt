Hand Evaluation
This hand is land-heavy (5 lands) and misses the cheap cantrips that fuel the Wraith/storm plan, but it is still playable and not strictly unkeepable under the deck's mulligan guidance. It has Dimir Signet (a valid ramp piece) and multiple lands so you can reliably cast your commander in the early turns and start building toward either the Voltron or token plan. The Grey Havens gives a small scry to find gas, and Nazgûl Battle-Mace is a useful piece to have early for later equipping. Downsides: no immediate cheap instants/sorceries to generate Wraiths on turn you get the commander, and Barad-dûr/Rivendell may enter tapped without a legendary creature, so your early turns may be a bit clunky. Given the instruction to be lenient and only mulligan truly dead hands (0–1 lands, 6+ lands, or no path forward), this hand has a clear path forward—ramp into commander and then dig for cantrips—so keep it.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play The Grey Havens (hand index 1). It enters untapped and scries 1, which improves card quality on turn 1 while putting a land onto the battlefield to enable future plays. This follows the priority to make a land drop first (ramp/mana), gives filtering for early game, and avoids the life loss that Underground River would cause if used for colored mana.

AI Strategic Decision
Cast Dimir Signet for {2}. This is the most mana-efficient play available: it advances our ramp (priority MANA), enabling faster access to colored mana and smoothing into Lord of the Nazgûl or other early plays. With only 2 total mana available and a land already played, the signet is the best use of resources on turn 1 to accelerate future turns.

No available mana (0). I've already played my land this turn, and there are no 0-cost spells or activated abilities in hand that can be used now. Battlefield has no usable activated abilities I can pay for with 0 mana. Under the critical mana rules, I cannot 'tap' lands or activate battlefield mana abilities from hand, so there's literally nothing castable or activatable this main phase.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play Underground River (hand index 0). Priority is land drop and mana/ramp — Underground River comes in untapped and gives immediate future access to U or B (important for getting Lord of the Nazgûl online) and color-fixes better than playing a tapped Barad-dûr or Rivendell. The life ping only happens when you later tap it for U/B and is an acceptable trade for early ramp/fixing. This advances the MANA plan for turns 2–3 without wasting the turn.

ENGINE
AI Strategic Decision
Casting Lord of the Nazgûl for 5 now is the highest-value play: it advances our engine (getting the commander online early to start generating Wraith value from subsequent spells), and it immediately makes us control a legendary creature — which will cause future copies of Barad-dûr and Rivendell to enter untapped so our next turns are smoother. We have the required U and B and sufficient total mana (5 ≤ 8). There are no cheaper meaningful plays in hand and the only other nonland option (Nazgûl Battle‑Mace) is best cast later when we have a creature to equip or when opponents present sacrifice interactions. Saving mana for responses is less important than progressing the plan on turn 2.

Take the land drop first. Rivendell will enter untapped because I control a legendary creature (commander/Lord of the Nazgûl) and gives an on-board engine (access to {1}{U}, {T}: Scry 2) on a subsequent step. Scrying improves card quality and is higher-value early-game sequencing than the other land options. This advances the deck's engine without wasting the current mana pool.

THREAT
AI Strategic Decision
With one land drop already used, the only meaningful nonland play in hand is Nazgûl Battle-Mace (index 2). Casting it for {5} uses available mana efficiently (8 total → 3 remaining after resolution), advances the deck's gameplan by providing a powerful equipment to turn Lord of the Nazgûl into a much larger, evasive, and resilient threat, and sets up future equip/attack lines. There are no 0-cost or higher-priority engine plays available, so investing in the equipment this turn is the best way to improve board presence and pressure opponents next turn.

Play Barad-dûr (hand index 0). Land drop is highest priority. Barad-dûr will enter untapped because our commander (a legendary creature) is already on the battlefield, giving immediate access to another black source on future turns and providing an amass activation later. This advances our mana base (MANA), preserves the current 5 mana for casting spells later in the turn if needed, and prioritizes ramp/synergy over casting the Commander's Sphere now.

Cast Commander's Sphere (hand index 4). With no playable nonland cards besides lands in hand and having already taken the land drop, the highest-value play this turn is to deploy a mana rock. Commander's Sphere is efficient ramp that fixes colors for our commander and future plays, can be sacrificed to draw a card later, and uses available mana productively instead of passing. This advances the MANA tier of our plan and leaves us better set to deploy engines/threats on subsequent turns.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play a basic Swamp from hand. Priority 1 is to take my land drop to improve future mana consistency and avoid the tempo loss of Bojuka Bog entering tapped. I have plenty of black in my pool and my deck/commander are black‑centric, so a Swamp is the most flexible untapped play this turn. Bojuka Bog is the only land with an immediate ETB effect (graveyard exile) but it enters tapped and would cost tempo; if an opponent’s graveyard poses an active threat I would instead play index 4. No other playable nonland cards exist, so the land drop is the correct MANA-driven play.

Per the critical mana rules, I cannot 'activate' lands or mana rocks manually to spend the available mana, and there are no non-mana abilities in hand to pay for. The deck plan calls for spending mana on engines or threats, but none are available, so passing is the only legal, productive action this step.

AI Strategic Decision
All cards in hand are lands and I've already used my one land drop this turn. There are no castable spells, no battlefield activated abilities to use, and per the critical mana rules I cannot 'activate' lands or mana rocks from hand. With no playable actions that advance the board or engine this step, passing is the only legal and productive choice.
T8
main2
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
I have already used my one land drop this turn and every card in hand is a land (Swamp, Island, Bojuka Bog, Swamp), so none are castable. There are no castable spells or battlefield activated abilities available and the critical mana rules forbid 'activating' lands or mana rocks from hand. With no legal or productive plays to advance the board or engine, passing is the correct play to avoid wasting mana or illegal actions.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Use my land drop now. Bojuka Bog (hand index 2) provides immediate non-mana value by exiling a player's graveyard on entry, which is high-impact in late game to disrupt reanimation/yard strategies. Entering tapped is acceptable — I already have ample mana this turn and no nonland spells in hand to cast — so this maximizes long-term value and advances the board. Playing a land also satisfies the first priority (land drop) before passing with no spells to cast.

main1
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
No castable nonland spells or battlefield activated abilities are available. I already used my land drop (Has Played Land This Turn: true), and the entire hand consists of lands/Command Tower which must be played via the land drop action (not cast) — that option is no longer available this turn. Per the critical mana/activation rules I cannot manually activate mana abilities to spend the pool. With nothing productive to cast or activate, passing is the correct play to avoid illegal actions and preserve resources for the next turn.
T9
main1
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
No legal productive plays exist. I have already used my land drop this turn, and every card in hand is a land that can only be played via a land drop (cannot be cast or activated from hand). There are no battlefield activated abilities available and the commander is already on the battlefield. Per the critical mana rules I must not attempt to manually activate mana abilities; the available mana pool cannot be spent on anything in hand. Passing preserves game state and available mana for the next turn and avoids illegal actions.

PASS
AI Strategic Decision
I have already used my land drop this turn and every card in hand is a land (indices 0–3). Lands in hand cannot be cast as spells or have battlefield abilities activated from hand. There are no non-mana activated abilities available and the commander is already on the battlefield. Per the critical mana rules I may not manually activate mana abilities and there are no castable spells or activatable hand abilities, so passing is the only legal, productive action to preserve game state and the available mana for next turn.
T9
main2
PASS
AI Strategic Decision
All four cards in hand are lands and I have already taken my land drop this turn, so I cannot legally cast or play any of them. There are no non-mana activated abilities available on the battlefield and no spells to cast. Per the critical mana rules, I must not manually activate mana abilities and floating unused mana is the only option; therefore passing is the only productive/legal action this step.

MANA
AI Strategic Decision
Play a land first per priority. Command Tower enters untapped and gives perfect color fixing for the commander without paying life (unlike The Black Gate). It maximizes future flexibility and costs nothing this turn, so it's the highest-value land drop from hand.

AI Strategic Decision
You have already taken your land drop this turn (Command Tower was played). All cards in hand are lands (two Swamps, an Island, The Black Gate) so there are no castable spells or available battlefield activated abilities to use. Per the critical mana rules, we must not manually tap lands or activate mana abilities, and floating unused mana is pointless. With no productive play available this main phase, the correct action is to pass and preserve the full mana pool for the next turn.

No legal, productive plays are available this Main Phase. Every card in hand is a land (indexes 0–3). You have already taken your land drop this turn, so you cannot play another land. There are no nonland spells to cast and no battlefield activated abilities available to use. Under the critical mana rules, mana abilities (lands/artifacts) are automatic and cannot be activated from hand, and cycling/other hand activations are not present. Therefore the only optimal play is to pass and preserve the board and full mana pool for the next turn.
